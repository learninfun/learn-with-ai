3. How can web application developers prevent CSRF attacks?
Answer: Web application developers can prevent CSRF attacks by implementing measures such as anti-CSRF tokens, session control, and secure cookie management.

4. How can website visitors protect themselves from CSRF attacks?
Answer: Website visitors can protect themselves from CSRF attacks by disabling third-party cookies, not logging into multiple web applications at once, and using browser extensions that block CSRF attacks.

5. Which web applications are most vulnerable to CSRF attacks?
Answer: Any web application that relies on cookies or other browser-based authentication mechanisms is vulnerable to CSRF attacks. However, web applications that expose sensitive information or support financial transactions are particularly attractive targets for attackers.
