1. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that enables attackers to inject malicious code into web pages viewed by other users. 

2. Attackers use various types of XSS, including reflected, stored, and DOM-based attacks, to target web applications, usually targeting vulnerable input fields, such as search boxes, message forums, and login forms. 

3. The consequences of an XSS attack can vary, from defacing websites or stealing sensitive data to redirecting users to malicious web pages or crafting hyperlinks that deliver malware. 

4. To prevent XSS, web developers should adopt secure coding techniques, such as input validation, sanitization, and output escaping, and use security tools, such as Content Security Policy (CSP) and cross-site scripting filters. 

5. Users can protect themselves by keeping their software up to date, using anti-malware software, disabling or limiting scripting and plugin capabilities in their browsers, and being cautious of clicking on links or downloading attachments from suspicious sources.
