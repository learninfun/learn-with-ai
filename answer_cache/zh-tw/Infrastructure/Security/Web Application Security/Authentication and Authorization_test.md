1. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
Answer: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, while authorization is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources or actions based on the user's identity and permissions.

2. What are some common authentication methods?
Answer: Some common authentication methods include passwords, biometric authentication (such as fingerprint or facial recognition), and two-factor authentication (which requires a second form of verification, such as a code sent via text message).

3. What is a "session cookie" in the context of web authentication?
Answer: A session cookie is a small piece of data that a web server sends to a user's browser to identify and authenticate the user during their session on the website. The cookie is typically deleted when the user closes their browser.

4. What is the concept of "least privilege" in authorization?
Answer: The principle of least privilege states that users should only be granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their required tasks. This helps reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protects sensitive data from being misused.

5. What is role-based access control?
Answer: Role-based access control (RBAC) is an authorization model where access to resources is based on the user's role within an organization. Each role has a defined set of permissions that determine what actions they can perform and what data they can access.
