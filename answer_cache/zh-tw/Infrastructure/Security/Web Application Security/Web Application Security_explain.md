Web application security refers to the measures taken to protect a website or web application from attacks, unauthorized access, data loss, or data theft. It involves implementing various security protocols, coding practices, and testing methodologies to ensure the security of the web application.

An example of a web application security attack is a SQL injection attack. In such attacks, hackers exploit vulnerabilities in a web application's code to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database. This can lead to unauthorized access to the database, data theft, and data manipulation.

To prevent such attacks, web application security measures like input validation, sanitization of user inputs, and parameterized queries must be implemented. Additionally, using secure network protocols like HTTPS and regularly scanning for vulnerabilities can also help ensure the security of a web application.
