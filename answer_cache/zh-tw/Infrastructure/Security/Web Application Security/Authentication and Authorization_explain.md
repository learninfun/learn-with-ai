Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It basically ensures that a user is who they claim to be. Authentication can be achieved in various ways, such as through passwords, biometric identification, or multi-factor authentication.

Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of granting or denying access to resources or services based on the authenticated user's identity and their level of access permissions. Authorization ensures that an authenticated user has the right to access the resources they have requested.

Example:

Suppose you want to access your online banking account. First, you need to enter your username and password (authentication). Once the bank verifies your identity, it will authorize you to access your account and perform transactions that you are authorized to perform. In this example, authentication and authorization work together to ensure the security of the banking system and prevent any unauthorized access to customers' accounts.
