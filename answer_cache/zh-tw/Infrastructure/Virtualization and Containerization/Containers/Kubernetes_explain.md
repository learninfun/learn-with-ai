Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It is a tool that is designed to manage containerized applications across multiple hosts, providing developers with an efficient and streamlined way to deploy and manage their applications at scale.

In simple terms, Kubernetes is used to manage and automate the deployment and scaling of container-based applications. With Kubernetes, developers can deploy and run their applications in a highly available and fault-tolerant manner, with automatic scaling and self-healing capabilities.

For example, if an e-commerce website is built on a container-based architecture, Kubernetes can be used to manage the deployment and scaling of the application. With Kubernetes, the application can be automatically scaled up or down based on the traffic load and resource requirements, ensuring optimal performance and availability. Kubernetes can also provide advanced features such as service discovery and load balancing, making it easier for the application to handle requests from multiple sources.
