1. What is the primary difference between virtualization and containerization?
Answer: In virtualization, a virtual machine emulates a complete hardware system, while in containerization, containers share the host's kernel and resources.

2. Why is containerization considered more lightweight than virtualization?
Answer: Containers use a shared operating system kernel, which reduces overhead and makes them more lightweight than virtual machines.

3. Can containers be used for isolation and security purposes?
Answer: Yes, containers can be used to isolate applications and processes and enhance security by preventing potential vulnerabilities from spreading to other parts of the system.

4. How does containerization improve application deployment and scalability?
Answer: Containerization makes it easier to package, deploy, and update applications, as well as scale them up or down based on demand, without requiring significant changes to the underlying infrastructure.

5. What are some common challenges associated with managing a virtualized or containerized environment?
Answer: Some common challenges include maintaining consistent configurations and ensuring compatibility between containers or virtual machines, managing resource allocation and performance, and handling networking and storage requirements.
