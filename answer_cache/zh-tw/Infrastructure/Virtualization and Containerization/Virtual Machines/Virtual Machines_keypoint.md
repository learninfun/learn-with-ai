- Virtual Machines (VMs) are software-based representations of physical computers that can run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single physical machine.
- They are isolated from each other and from the host operating system, providing a secure and flexible environment.
- VMs can be created, managed, and deleted easily, allowing for dynamic allocation of resources and increased efficiency.
- They can be easily replicated and migrated, allowing for easy scalability and disaster recovery.
- VMs can be used for testing and development, server consolidation, cloud computing, and other virtualization use cases.
- The performance of virtual machines can be affected by the hardware resources allocated to them, such as CPU, RAM, storage, and network connectivity.
- There are different types of virtualization, including full virtualization, para-virtualization, and hardware virtualization, each with its unique advantages and constraints.
