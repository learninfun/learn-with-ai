1. Approximation ratio: Approximation algorithms aim to find solutions that are within a certain percentage of the optimal solution. The approximation ratio is defined as the ratio between the objective function value of the approximation algorithm and the optimal objective function value.

2. Polynomial Time: Approximation algorithms must run in polynomial time since it is not feasible to obtain optimal solutions for many optimization problems in polynomial time.

3. Trade-off between speed and accuracy: Approximation algorithms must balance speed and accuracy to achieve reasonable solutions for practical problems.

4. Greedy approach: Many approximation algorithms use a greedy approach that selects the best action at each step, without considering the impact on future steps.

5. Randomization: Randomization can be used in approximation algorithms to overcome limitations in the greedy approach or to achieve better approximation ratios.

6. Performance guarantees: Approximation algorithms provide performance guarantees that ensure the quality of the solution obtained regardless of the input instance.

7. Applications: Approximation algorithms are widely used in various fields, including computer science, operations research, and engineering, to solve optimization problems in practice.
