1. What is the time complexity of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm?
2. Can the Edmonds-Karp algorithm solve the maximum flow problem in a directed graph with negative edge weights? Why or why not?
3. What is the maximum flow that can be achieved using the Edmonds-Karp algorithm in a flow network with multiple sources and sinks?
4. How does the Edmonds-Karp algorithm differ from Ford-Fulkerson algorithm in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy in finding the maximal flow?
5. Can the Edmonds-Karp algorithm be modified to handle undirected graphs or bipartite graphs? If so, how?
