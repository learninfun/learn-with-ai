1. Online Convex Optimization is a method for solving optimization problems where the objective function is not known in advance.

2. Online Convex Optimization algorithms are designed to handle situations where the data arrives in a stream and is not pre-processed.

3. Online Convex Optimization algorithms make use of the gradient of the objective function to update the solution as new data arrives.

4. The performance of Online Convex Optimization algorithms is typically measured by the regret, which is the difference between the objective function value of the algorithm and that of the optimal solution.

5. The main advantage of Online Convex Optimization is that it allows for fast adaptation to changing environments and can be used in a wide range of applications, such as machine learning, signal processing, and control.

6. Online Convex Optimization has many practical applications, including online advertising, recommendation systems, and financial modeling.
