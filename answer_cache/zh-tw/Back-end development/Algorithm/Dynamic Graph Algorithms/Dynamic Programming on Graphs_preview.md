1. Longest Path in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): Given a DAG, find the longest path from a source vertex to a sink vertex.
2. Shortest Path in a weighted DAG: Given a DAG with weighted edges, find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices.
3. Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP): Given a complete weighted graph, find the shortest possible route that visits every vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.
4. Maximum Flow in a graph: Given a graph with capacities on the edges, find the maximum flow that can be sent from a source vertex to a sink vertex.
5. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST): Given a weighted graph, find a subset of edges that connects all vertices and their total weight is minimized.
