1. Euclid's Algorithm is a method to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.
2. The algorithm states that the GCD of two integers a and b is equal to the GCD of b and the remainder of a divided by b.
3. The algorithm uses repeated division to find the GCD and is based on the fact that if a and b are integers, and b divides a, then the GCD of a and b is b.
4. Euclid's Algorithm is also known as the Euclidean Algorithm or the Euclidean Division Algorithm.
5. The algorithm can be extended to find the GCD of multiple integers by applying the algorithm repeatedly.
6. Euclid's Algorithm can also be used to find the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers by the formula: LCM(a, b) = (a x b) / GCD(a, b).
7. The time complexity of Euclid's Algorithm is O(log n) where n is the maximum of a and b.
8. The algorithm has been known since ancient times and is named after the Greek mathematician Euclid.
