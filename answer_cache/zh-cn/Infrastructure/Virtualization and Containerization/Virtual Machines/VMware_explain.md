VMware is a software application for virtualization that allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical computer. It enables businesses to run various operating systems and applications on a single physical server or computer, which helps save costs and reduce the impact on the environment. This technology works by simulating the hardware of a computer so that it can be shared by multiple virtual machines, each running its own operating system and software.

For example, a company may use VMware to have several virtual machines that run different operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS. The company can use these virtual machines to run different applications for various purposes such as web servers, databases, software testing, and development. This can help the company save money on hardware costs, simplify management, and improve system uptime.
