1. What is the difference between authentication and authorization in web application security?
Answer: Authentication refers to the process of verifying a user’s identity to ensure they are who they say they are, while authorization refers to the process of granting access to resources or actions based on a user’s identity and assigned privileges.

2. What is cross-site scripting (XSS) and how can it be prevented?
Answer: Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of web application vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into a legitimate website, allowing them to steal sensitive user data. It can be prevented by validating input and encoding output, using frameworks and libraries that offer security features, and implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP).

3. What is SQL injection and how can it be prevented?
Answer: SQL injection is a type of web application vulnerability where attackers exploit poorly written SQL queries to gain unauthorized access to a database. It can be prevented by using parameterized queries or stored procedures, limiting access privileges for the database user, and implementing input validation and sanitization.

4. What is session hijacking and how can it be prevented?
Answer: Session hijacking is a type of web application vulnerability where attackers steal a user’s session ID and use it to gain unauthorized access to the application. It can be prevented by using secure session management techniques such as session tokens, SSL encryption, and implementing a timeout policy to invalidate inactive sessions.

5. What is a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability and how can it be prevented?
Answer: A cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability is a type of web application vulnerability where attackers trick a user’s browser into executing unauthorized actions on a legitimate website. It can be prevented by using a unique token for each user session, limiting the amount of time the token is valid, and implementing server-side validation to ensure that all requests are authenticated and authorized.
