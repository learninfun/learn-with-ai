SQL Injection is a technique used by attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the database of a website. It is a type of cyber attack that occurs when a malicious user inserts a malicious code into a website's form that is used to query the database. The attacker can then bypass the website's security and manipulate the database to perform unintended functions.

For example, let’s assume there is an e-commerce website that uses SQL to conduct transactions. A hacker could enter a malicious SQL code string such as "DROP TABLE Products" into the input field. Once the query is run, the entire products table will be deleted. SQL Injection can also be used to steal sensitive data such as credit card details or personal identifications that the web server might have. By successfully executing SQL Injection attacks, attackers can gain unauthorized access to a website’s vulnerable database and commit destructive actions against it.
