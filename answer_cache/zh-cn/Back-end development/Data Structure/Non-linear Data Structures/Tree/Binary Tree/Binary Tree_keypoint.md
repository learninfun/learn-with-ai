1. Binary Tree is a type of data structure where each node has at most two children. 

2. The first node of the binary tree is called the root, and it is the starting point for the tree. 

3. Each node in the binary tree holds a value or data, which can be of any data type. 

4. The left child of a node has a smaller value than the node, while the right child has a larger value. 

5. The height of the binary tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the farthest leaf node. 

6. Binary trees can be used for traversing or searching for data efficiently. 

7. There are different types of binary trees, such as binary search trees, heap trees, balanced trees, and complete trees. 

8. The time complexity for basic binary tree operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching is O(log n) in the average case and O(n) in the worst case. 

9. Binary trees can be represented using arrays, linked lists, or specialized data structures such as threaded trees or AVL trees. 

10. There are various algorithms for traversing binary trees, such as inorder, preorder, postorder, and level-order.
