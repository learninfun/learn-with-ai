1. What is the time complexity of Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm for an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges?
2. How does Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm traverse the graph and what is the advantage of it over DFS?
3. Can you explain the main idea behind Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph?
4. How does the A* search algorithm differ from other graph traversal algorithms and what are some applications where it is commonly used?
5. What is the maximum possible number of connected components in an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges, and how can you find them all using a suitable graph traversal algorithm?
