Kafka is a distributed streaming platform designed to build real-time data streaming applications. It's a messaging system that facilitates the sharing of data between different applications or software systems in real-time.

For instance, let's consider a scenario where an e-commerce platform wants to send information on users' purchases to the shipping and billing systems in real-time as the orders are placed by the customers. The traditional approach would be to update the database and then trigger the relevant systems to update their data. However, this approach can create a delay in the process and limit the scalability.

Using Kafka, the e-commerce platform can send the purchase information to a Kafka broker that acts as a messaging system, and the shipping and billing systems can subscribe to the applicable topics to receive the relevant information on an ongoing basis. This allows the systems to operate in real-time and provide better customer service.

In summary, Kafka enables real-time data streaming between different applications, making it a useful tool in many industries, including finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and more.
