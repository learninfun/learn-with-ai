1. What is the difference between monitoring and logging?
Answer: Monitoring is the act of observing system performance in real-time, while logging refers to the act of capturing events or messages and storing them for future reference.

2. How can logging be used to troubleshoot issues in a system?
Answer: Logging can be used to identify the root cause of an issue by reviewing system events leading up to the problem. By analyzing the logs, you can pinpoint the specific component or function that caused the issue.

3. What is the purpose of log rotation?
Answer: Log rotation is the process of automatically archiving or deleting older logs to prevent the storage device from running out of space. It ensures that logs are not lost and that new events can be captured without interruption.

4. Why is monitoring important in modern application development and maintenance?
Answer: Monitoring allows developers and IT teams to quickly identify and resolve issues in a system, ensuring that the system is always available and functioning properly. This reduces downtime, improves user experience, and saves businesses from significant financial losses.

5. How can alerts and notifications be configured to improve monitoring efficiency?
Answer: Alerts and notifications can be set up to notify IT teams when specific events or performance thresholds are met. This allows proactive issue resolution before they lead to downtime, data corruption, or data loss. Configuring alerts and notifications also frees up IT resources that can focus on other important system functions.
