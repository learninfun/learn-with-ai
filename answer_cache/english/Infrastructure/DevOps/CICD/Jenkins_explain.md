Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps automate various stages of the software development process, including building, testing, and deploying applications. It allows developers to automate repetitive tasks, thereby saving time and improving efficiency.

For example, consider a team of developers working on a web application. They use Jenkins to automate the entire build and deployment process. Whenever code changes are made, Jenkins automatically retrieves the modified code from a repository, builds the application, runs various tests, and deploys the application to a staging or production environment. In addition, Jenkins also generates reports that highlight any potential issues or errors in the application.

Overall, Jenkins enables developers to streamline the development process and ensure that high-quality code is delivered to customers quickly and efficiently.
