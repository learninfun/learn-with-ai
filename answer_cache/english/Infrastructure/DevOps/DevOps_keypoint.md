1. Collaboration: DevOps is all about collaboration between developers, operations teams, and other stakeholders in the software development lifecycle.

2. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery: DevOps aims to enable continuous integration and delivery of software to ensure faster time-to-market and more frequent releases.

3. Automation: Automation of various steps in the software development process is critical to DevOps. Automation can reduce human error and speed up the process.

4. Infrastructure as Code: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice where infrastructure is treated as code. This enables the automation of infrastructure provisioning and management.

5. Monitoring and Logging: DevOps stresses the importance of monitoring and logging throughout the software development cycle. This allows for identifying and resolving issues in real-time.

6. Agile Methodologies: DevOps is closely aligned with agile methodologies that emphasize a continuous feedback loop and iterative development process.

7. Security and Compliance: DevOps ensures that security and compliance are integrated into the software development process from the beginning.

8. Culture: DevOps is a culture that prioritizes collaboration, experimentation, and continuous improvement over individual achievements.
