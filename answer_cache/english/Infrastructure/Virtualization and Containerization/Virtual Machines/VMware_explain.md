VMware is a virtualization platform that allows multiple virtual machines-running different operating systems-to run on the same physical machine. Essentially, VMware creates a virtual computer inside a physical computer, allowing multiple operating systems to run on a single machine.

For example, a company may use VMware to run multiple servers on a single physical machine. By virtualizing these servers, the company can reduce physical space required, reduce hardware costs, and easier maintenance.

Another example is a software developer who needs to test their software on multiple operating systems. They can use VMware to run different virtual machines with different operating systems, allowing them to test their software on a variety of platforms without needing multiple physical machines.
