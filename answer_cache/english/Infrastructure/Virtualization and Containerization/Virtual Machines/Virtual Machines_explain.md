Virtual Machines (VMs) are software simulations of a computer system that enables multiple operating systems (OS) to run on one physical server or workstation. A virtual machine typically comprises an operating system, virtual hardware (CPU, memory, storage), and applications.

Example:

A common use of virtual machines is to create 'sandboxed' environments for testing or running software. For example, a software development company might create virtual machines for running different versions of operating systems and software applications to test for compatibility, while an individual might deploy a virtual machine to test software or malware without risking damage to their primary operating system. One popular software solution for creating virtual machines is VMware, which allows users to deploy virtual machines on their desktop or server.
