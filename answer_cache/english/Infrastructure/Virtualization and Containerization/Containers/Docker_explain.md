Docker is a containerization technology that allows developers to easily create, deploy, and run applications in a portable and isolated environment called a container. Docker enables developers to package their applications with all necessary dependencies and configurations, making it easy to deploy them on different platforms and environments while ensuring consistency and reliability.

For example, letâ€™s say a developer wants to create and deploy a web application that consists of multiple components such as web server, database, and backend application. With Docker, the developer can create a container for each of these components and package them together to form a complete application. The containers can be easily deployed on any platform or infrastructure, including cloud, on-premises, or hybrid environments. This means that developers can easily build, test, and deploy applications quickly and consistently, without worrying about compatibility issues or dependencies. Docker has emerged as a powerful tool for DevOps teams looking to streamline their development and deployment processes, enabling them to deliver better software faster.
