Infrastructure refers to the foundational systems and structures that support a society's social, economic, and political activities. It includes physical structures like buildings, roads, and bridges, and digital systems like communication networks and information technology systems.

An example of infrastructure might be a city's transportation network, which includes a combination of roads, bridges, public transit systems, airports, and bike lanes. The transportation network enables people and goods to move easily and efficiently within the city, which supports economic growth and improves quality of life for residents. Without this infrastructure, the city would experience increased congestion, lower productivity, and reduced access to essential services.
