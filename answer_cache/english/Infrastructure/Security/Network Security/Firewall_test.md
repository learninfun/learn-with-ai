1. What is the purpose of an ingress firewall rule?
Answer: It controls incoming traffic to a network or device by allowing or blocking specific protocols, IP addresses, or ports.

2. How do stateful firewalls differ from stateless firewalls?
Answer: Stateful firewalls maintain context about the communications being protected and evaluate traffic against previous known good traffic. Stateless firewalls inspect traffic based on individual packets and do not maintain this type of context.

3. What is the difference between an application-layer firewall and a network-layer firewall?
Answer: An application-layer firewall examines specific application-layer protocols such as HTTP, FTP and SMTP, while a network-layer firewall inspects packets at a lower level of the network stack and usually provides more generic filtering.

4. What is packet filtering?
Answer: It is a technique used by firewalls to selectively allow or block traffic based on set rules. Packets are evaluated based on their header information like source and destination IP address, protocol, source and destination port numbers.

5. What is a virtual private network (VPN) gateway firewall?
Answer: It is a firewall configured to allow VPN connections to connect through the firewall to the internal network. It is commonly used to provide remote access to employees to securely connect to the company network over the internet.
