A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a type of technology that is designed to create a secure, encrypted connection over the internet between a user's computer and a remote server or network. 

This type of connection allows users to access resources on the remote network as if they were directly connected to it, while also providing an added layer of protection against cyber threats and unwanted snooping. 

For example, consider a company that has offices in different locations and employees that frequently work from home or on the go. By setting up a VPN, the employees can securely connect to the company's network from any location, giving them access to all the company's resources, such as files, databases, and applications, as if they were working from the office. This makes it easier for employees to work remotely while still maintaining the security of company data.
