Denial of Service (DoS) protection is a set of techniques and technologies designed to prevent or mitigate the impact of a Denial of Service attack. A Denial of Service attack (DoS) is an attempt to disrupt or overload a target computer or network to prevent it from providing services to its intended users. 

DoS protection includes a range of security measures, such as firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, load balancers, and content delivery networks. These measures can help filter out malicious traffic and prevent attackers from taking down a network or server.

For example, if a website is being attacked with a DDoS attack, DoS protection measures can identify and block malicious traffic, and distribute legitimate traffic to multiple servers to prevent a single server from being overwhelmed. This ensures that the website remains operational and available to legitimate users, despite the attack.

Overall, DoS protection is essential for maintaining the availability and integrity of computer networks, particularly for organizations that depend on their networks for critical business functions.
