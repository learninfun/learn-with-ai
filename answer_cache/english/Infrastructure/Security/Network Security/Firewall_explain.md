Firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier to protect the network by filtering traffic and blocking unauthorized access attempts. 

For instance, a company might use a firewall to prevent outside traffic from entering its network, while allowing its own employees to access the internet. A firewall can monitor traffic based on different criteria including IP addresses, protocols, and ports. It can also be configured to block websites and applications that are deemed risky or inappropriate for the organization. 

An example of a firewall could be the Windows firewall that comes pre-installed in the Microsoft operating system. This firewall is designed to protect computers from unwanted traffic, blocking incoming traffic that is not part of an established connection, and opening ports only when required by authorized applications.
