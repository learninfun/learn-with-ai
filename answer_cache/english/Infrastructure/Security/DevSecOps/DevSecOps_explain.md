DevSecOps is the practice of integrating security seamlessly into the software delivery pipeline as early as possible. It ensures that security is not an afterthought but is woven into the software development lifecycle. This approach fosters a culture of collaboration between development, security, and operations teams, enabling them to work together to create secure, quality software.

As an example, consider a healthcare technology company developing a new mobile app to manage medication for patients. The development team incorporates the necessary security measures and testing into the application from the beginning, while the security team monitors the code for vulnerabilities and identifies them for remediation. The operations team ensures that the application runs smoothly in production and that sensitive patient information is protected. The result is a fully secure and compliant app that meets regulatory requirements while meeting the patients' needs.
