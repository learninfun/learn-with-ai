1. Same-origin policy is a security measure implemented by web browsers to prevent malicious scripts from accessing sensitive data on different websites.
2. It restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain or port, except those explicitly allowed by the server.
3. The policy is based on the concept of origin, which is a combination of protocol, domain, and port.
4. It aims to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, and other security vulnerabilities.
5. Same-origin policy applies to different web technologies, such as JavaScript, AJAX, and plugins.
6. Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that enables web servers to relax the same-origin policy in a controlled way.
7. Same-origin policy has some limitations and exceptions, such as the ability to share cookies between subdomains and the use of JSONP (JSON with Padding) for cross-domain scripting.
8. Developers can use various techniques to work around the same-origin policy, but they should be cautious and only use them when necessary.
