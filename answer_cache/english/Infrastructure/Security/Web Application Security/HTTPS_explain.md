HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is a protocol used to secure and encrypt communications between a web browser and a website. In other words, it adds an extra layer of security to the standard HTTP protocol, which is otherwise not safe for transmitting sensitive information online.

When a user types "https://" in the address bar of a web browser, a secure connection is established and all data transmitted between the browser and the web server is encrypted. This ensures that the data cannot be intercepted, read or modified by hackers or other third parties.

An example of a website that uses HTTPS is Gmail from Google. When users log in to their Gmail account, they will notice that the URL in the address bar starts with "https://" instead of "http://". This indicates that the connection is secure and encrypted.
