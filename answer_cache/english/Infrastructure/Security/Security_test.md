1. What is the difference between encryption and hashing in terms of security?

Answer: Encryption hides data content by converting it into a different form that only authorized users can decode, while hashing is a one-way process that creates a unique fixed-length digest of data that can be verified without revealing the original data.

2. What are the common types of authentication methods used in networks?

Answer: The three common types of authentication methods are knowledge-based (passwords or PINs), possession-based (smart cards or tokens), and biometrics (fingerprint, facial recognition, or voice).

3. What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?

Answer: Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data, while asymmetric encryption uses a public key to encrypt the data and a private key to decrypt it.

4. What is a DDoS attack and how can it be prevented?

Answer: A DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attack is a type of cyber attack where a network of infected computers flood a target server with traffic to overwhelm it and cause it to crash. It can be prevented by implementing anti-DDoS solutions such as traffic filtering, traffic-shaping, or using a cloud-based security service.

5. What is social engineering and how can it be avoided?

Answer: Social engineering is a technique used by cyber attackers to manipulate people into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. It can be avoided by raising awareness among employees and implementing security policies and procedures that verify identity, limit access, and prevent unauthorized disclosures.
