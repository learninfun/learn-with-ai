Cloud security refers to the set of measures taken to protect cloud computing environments and the data stored within them from accidental or malicious access, theft, deletion, or unauthorized modification. The primary goal of cloud security is to ensure that sensitive and confidential information is safe in the cloud, and that the cloud infrastructure and applications are secure from attacks.

An example of cloud security would be implementing strong authentication and access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the cloud resources. This can be done by using multifactor authentication, such as a combination of passwords and biometric factors like fingerprints or facial recognition, and implementing role-based access control, which grants access to data and services on a need-to-know basis, based on a user's job function or level of authorization. Additionally, data encryption can be used to protect sensitive data in transit and at rest. These measures help to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access to the cloud resources.
