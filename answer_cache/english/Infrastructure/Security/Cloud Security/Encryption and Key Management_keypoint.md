Encryption:
1. Encryption is the process of converting plain text into a secret code, known as cipher text.
2. The aim of encryption is to protect data from unauthorized access or theft.
3. Encryption can be done using symmetric encryption, where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, or asymmetric encryption, which involves using a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
4. Strong encryption algorithms such as AES, Blowfish, and RSA are used to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data.

Key Management:
1. Key management is the process of securely creating, storing, distributing, and revoking cryptographic keys.
2. Cryptographic keys are long, complex, and secret strings of characters used in encryption to protect data.
3. Proper key management is essential to maintain the security of encrypted data.
4. Key management involves generating and storing keys securely, distributing keys only to authorized parties, revoking keys if they become compromised or if the user no longer has a need for them, and rotating keys periodically.
5. Best practices for key management include using a trusted key management system, limiting access to keys, and periodically reviewing and updating key management policies and procedures.
