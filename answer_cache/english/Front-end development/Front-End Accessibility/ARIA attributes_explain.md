ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) are HTML attributes that provide additional information about web page elements to assistive technologies such as screen readers, making the website content more accessible to people with disabilities.

Here is an example of an ARIA attribute:

< button aria-label="Menu Toggle" >




The aria-label attribute provides a concise and meaningful label or text alternative for an element, in this case, a button. When a screen reader encounters the element with the ARIA attribute aria-label, it will read out the descriptive text that is provided in the attribute, making it easier for a user with visual impairments to understand the operation of the button.

Overall, ARIA attributes can make web content more accessible and inclusive to everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.
