1. ARIA attributes are used to add extra information to HTML tags so that assistive technology tools can understand them better.
2. ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications.
3. ARIA attributes can be used to define roles, states, and properties of elements in HTML.
4. Roles define how an element interacts with assistive technology and what purpose it serves.
5. States describe the condition of an element at a given moment, for example, whether it's expanded or collapsed.
6. Properties provide additional information about an element, such as its value or label.
7. ARIA attributes should only be used when there are no other HTML elements available to convey the same information.
8. ARIA attributes should be used sparingly and only when necessary, as they can often be confusing and potentially misleading for users of assistive technology.
9. ARIA attributes are not a substitute for good HTML structure and should be used in conjunction with other accessibility techniques.
10. ARIA attributes are supported by most modern web browsers and assistive technology tools.
