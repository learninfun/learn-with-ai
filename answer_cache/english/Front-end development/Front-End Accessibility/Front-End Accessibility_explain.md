Front-End Accessibility refers to the designing and developing of websites and applications in a way that makes them accessible for users with disabilities. This means that the design and code should be optimized for assistive technologies such as screen readers, speech recognition software and alternate input devices for people with physical impairments.

An example of Front-End Accessibility is the use of alternative text (alt text) with images. Alt text provides a description of an image that can be read by screen readers, enabling users with visual impairments to understand the content of the image. This is also useful when an image cannot be loaded or viewed due to technical difficulties.

Another example is designing web pages with clear and consistent headings and using appropriate markup language for technical terms and abbreviations. This helps users with cognitive and learning disabilities as well those with limited English proficiency to comprehend the content easily. 

By implementing Front-End Accessibility practices, websites and applications can ensure that they provide a seamless and accessible user experience for all individuals, regardless of their abilities.
