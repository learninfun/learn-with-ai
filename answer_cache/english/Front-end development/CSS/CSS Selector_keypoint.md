- In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), a selector is a pattern that is used to select specific elements in an HTML or XML document for styling and formatting.
- CSS selectors are based on the element's attributes, attributes values, class, and ID.
- The basic CSS selector is the element selector, which targets all instances of a specific HTML element (e.g., div, p, h1, etc.).
- Class selectors are used to target elements that have a specific class attribute value.
- ID selectors are used to target elements that have a specific ID attribute value.
- Descendant selectors are used to target elements that are nested within other elements.
- Child selectors are used to target immediate child elements of a parent element.
- Universal selectors are used to target all elements within a document.
- Attribute selectors are used to target elements based on their attribute values.
- Pseudo-class selectors are used to target elements in specific states, such as hover, active, or focus.
- Pseudo-element selectors are used to target specific parts of an element, such as the first letter or line of text.
