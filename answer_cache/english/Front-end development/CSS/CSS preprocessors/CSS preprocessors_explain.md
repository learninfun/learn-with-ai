CSS preprocessors are a tool that allows developers to write CSS in a more advanced, efficient and time-saving way. They offer functionality such as variables, functions, mixins, nesting, and inheritance.

An example of a popular CSS preprocessor is Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets). It is a powerful and widely used CSS preprocessor that allows developers to write CSS in a more organized and efficient way. Hereâ€™s an example of how Sass makes writing CSS code easier:

// Declare a variable
$primary-color: #007bff;

// Use the variable in a selector
.button {
  background-color: $primary-color;
}

// Output CSS after the preprocessor compiles it
.button {
  background-color: #007bff;
}

In the example above, we define a variable for the primary color of a website. Sass allows us to use this variable within a CSS selector, saving time and making it easier to maintain. When the preprocessor compiles and outputs the final CSS code, it will replace the variable with the corresponding value.

Overall, CSS preprocessors offer a host of benefits to developers looking for a more efficient and streamlined way to write CSS code.
