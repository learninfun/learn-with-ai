1. What is cache coherence?
Answer: Cache coherence refers to the consistency of data across multiple caches in a distributed system. It ensures that multiple copies of the same data are kept up-to-date and synchronized across all caches.

2. What is cache hit ratio?
Answer: Cache hit ratio measures the percentage of requests that are served from the cache rather than from the original data source. A high hit ratio indicates efficient caching and faster response times.

3. What is cache invalidation?
Answer: Cache invalidation is the process of removing or updating cached data when it becomes stale or outdated. This ensures that users are always seeing the most up-to-date information and prevents data integrity issues.

4. What is cache warming?
Answer: Cache warming is the process of preloading frequently accessed data into a cache before it is requested. This can reduce latency and ensure that the data is readily available to users when they need it.

5. What is caching sharding?
Answer: Caching sharding is the process of partitioning cached data across multiple cache servers to improve scalability and performance. This allows for better load balancing and reduces the risk of data loss in case of server failures.
