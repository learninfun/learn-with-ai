Identifying and fixing performance bottlenecks refers to the process of identifying performance issues that are negatively impacting the performance of a system, application or network, and then fixing those issues to improve overall performance. A performance bottleneck is a point in the system where performance is limited or blocked, creating a slowdown or system failure.

For example, a website may experience performance bottlenecks if it has a slow-loading homepage, which can cause users to abandon the site before they even get started. The first step in identifying the bottleneck is to run a performance test, which can help pinpoint the issue. Common performance issues that can cause bottlenecks on a website include server load, network latency, and database queries.

To fix the bottleneck, it may be necessary to optimize the website code, reduce the number of HTTP requests, or optimize image sizes. Other solutions may include improving server memory or adding new hardware to handle the traffic. By identifying and fixing performance bottlenecks on the website, the user experience is improved and the overall performance is optimized.
