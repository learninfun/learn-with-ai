1. What is a common metric used to measure performance testing results?

Answer: Response time is a common metric used to measure performance testing results. It represents the time taken for a system to respond to a user request.

2. What is the difference between load testing and stress testing?

Answer: Load testing involves testing a system with a high volume of requests, whereas stress testing involves testing a system with a high volume of requests and also putting the system under extreme conditions.

3. What are the advantages of using a testing framework for performance testing?

Answer: A testing framework provides a structure and set of rules for managing and executing tests. It also helps to automate tests and reproduce test results, which saves time and effort.

4. What is a common tool used for load testing?

Answer: Apache JMeter is a common tool used for load testing. It is an open-source software application that can be used to test the performance of web applications, databases, and other services.

5. What are the main benefits of using cloud-based testing tools for performance testing?

Answer: Cloud-based testing tools provide scalable and flexible testing solutions that can be easily accessed from anywhere. They also offer cost-effective options for testing large systems or applications, without the need for expensive hardware or infrastructure.
