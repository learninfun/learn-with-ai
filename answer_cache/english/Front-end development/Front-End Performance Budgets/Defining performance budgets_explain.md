Defining performance budgets:

Performance budgeting is a budgeting process that is based on the explicit performance of an organization. This type of budgeting focuses on the desired results that an organization wants to achieve, and the resources needed to attain these goals. It involves linking budget allocations with performance outcomes, performance measures, and evaluation. The aim is to measure an organization's effectiveness and efficiency, and the degree to which its objectives have been accomplished.

Example:

A company that produces computers may use performance budgeting. The company wants to increase its market share by 10%, reduce its production costs by 5%, and improve customer satisfaction by 15% over the next fiscal year. As a result, the company must evaluate its current performance by measuring those three factors. Based on this assessment, it can decide how much resources it needs to allocate to meet its goals. So, it may set aside a budgetary amount for research and development to produce more efficient technology, another budgetary amount for marketing to improve customer satisfaction, and a third budgetary amount for cost-cutting strategies such as reducing waste and optimizing the supply chain. At the end of the fiscal year, the company can evaluate its performance against those three factors and adjust its budgetary allocation for the next fiscal year.
