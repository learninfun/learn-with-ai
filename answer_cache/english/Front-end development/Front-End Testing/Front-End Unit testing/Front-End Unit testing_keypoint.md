1. Front-end unit testing involves testing individual components or units of the front-end codebase.
2. It is typically done using specialized testing frameworks such as Jest, Mocha, or Jasmine.
3. Unit tests are designed to ensure that a specific piece of code (such as a function or method) works correctly and produces the expected output.
4. Front-end unit testing allows for faster and more efficient testing, as it isolates individual components and allows developers to quickly identify issues and bugs.
5. It also makes it easier to refactor code, as changes to one unit can be tested independently before being integrated into the broader codebase.
6. Key elements of a successful front-end unit testing strategy include writing well-designed tests, following best practices for test structure and organization, and regularly running automated tests as part of the software development lifecycle.
