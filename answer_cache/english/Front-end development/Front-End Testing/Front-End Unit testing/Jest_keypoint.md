1. Jest is an open-source JavaScript testing framework.
2. It is developed by Facebook and is commonly used with React, although it can also be used for other JavaScript projects.
3. Jest provides features like test setup and teardown, mocking, and code coverage reporting.
4. It has a built-in test runner that allows for parallel test execution, making it faster than other testing frameworks.
5. Jest supports multiple types of test cases, including unit tests, integration tests, and snapshot tests.
6. Snapshot tests allow developers to track changes in the output of components or functions over time, making it easier to catch regressions.
7. Jest uses an assertion library called Expect, which provides intuitive matchers for testing values.
8. It also has a watch mode that re-runs tests automatically when changes are made to the code.
9. Jest integrates with popular development tools like VS Code and can be installed as a plugin.
10. Jest has a large community of contributors and an active development cycle, ensuring it stays up-to-date with the latest best practices and trends in software testing.
