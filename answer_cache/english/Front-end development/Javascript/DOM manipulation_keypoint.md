1. DOM stands for Document Object Model, which is a programming interface for web documents.
2. DOM manipulation is the process of modifying the structure, content, or appearance of a web page using JavaScript.
3. DOM manipulation can involve selecting elements, adding or removing elements, changing styles and attributes, and handling events.
4. DOM methods allow developers to create dynamic and interactive websites, where content can be updated without refreshing the entire page.
5. Commonly used DOM methods include getElementById, getElementsByClassName, createElement, appendChild, removeChild, setAttribute, and addEventListener.
6. Proper DOM manipulation practices include using efficient methods, avoiding inline styles and scripts, optimizing selectors, and testing code across different browsers.
7. Libraries and frameworks like jQuery and React provide higher-level abstractions for DOM manipulation, simplifying the development process for complex web applications.
