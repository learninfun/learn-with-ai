1. A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function and the inner function has access to the outer function's variables, parameters, and functions.
2. Closures are used to create private variables and methods that are hidden from the global scope.
3. Closures can be used to create reusable functions that can be customized with different parameters each time they are called.
4. Closures can also be used to create asynchronous code by keeping track of the state of a function's variables and parameters even after the function has been called and returned.
5. Closures can improve performance by reducing the number of global variables and preventing accidental variable name collisions.
