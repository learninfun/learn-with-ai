Functional programming is a programming paradigm that aims to create software by building functions that produce outputs, rather than using objects and state changes. As a result, functional code is often easier to read, maintain, and test. In JavaScript, functional programming is supported by functional programming concepts such as pure functions, immutability, and higher-order functions.

A pure function is a function that always returns the same output for the same input, without any side effects. In other words, it does not modify any state or change any external variables. Here's an example of a pure function in JavaScript:

```
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

This function takes two arguments and returns their product. It does not modify any state or affect any external variables, making it a pure function.

Another concept of functional programming is immutability, which means that data should not be modified once it has been created. Instead, new data should be created from existing data. In JavaScript, this can be achieved by using methods such as `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.

For example, let's say we have an array of numbers and we want to multiply each number by 2 and store the result in a new array. Here's how we can do it using `map()`:

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((num) => num * 2);
console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

In this example, we create a new array called `doubledNumbers` that contains the result of multiplying each number in the `numbers` array by 2. The original `numbers` array is not modified.

Finally, higher-order functions are functions that either take one or more functions as arguments or return a function as their result. Examples of higher-order functions in JavaScript include `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.

Here's an example of a higher-order function that takes a function as its argument:

```
function multiplyBy(factor) {
  return function(num) {
    return num * factor;
  };
}

const double = multiplyBy(2);
console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10
```

In this example, we create a higher-order function called `multiplyBy()` that takes a factor as its argument and returns a new function that multiplies its argument by the factor. We then call `multiplyBy(2)` to create a new function called `double` that multiplies its argument by 2. Finally, we call `double(5)` to get the result of multiplying 5 by 2, which is 10.
