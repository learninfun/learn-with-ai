Prototypes are early models or samples of a product or concept developed to test and demonstrate its functionality, design, and potential. Prototyping is a crucial step in the product development process as it helps identify and resolve issues, make improvements, and gather feedback from stakeholders.

For example, if a company is developing a new smartphone, they may create several prototypes to evaluate and refine the design, features, and user experience. The prototypes may range from basic mockups made of cardboard or foam to working models with functional software and hardware components. User testing and feedback during the prototyping phase can guide the development team in making necessary changes and improvements to create a final product that meets customer needs and expectations.
