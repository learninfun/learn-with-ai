1. Asynchronous code allows tasks to be performed asynchronously, without blocking the execution of other code.
2. In JavaScript, asynchronous code can be achieved through the use of callback functions, promises, and async/await syntax.
3. Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions, which are then called when the task is completed.
4. Promises represent a value that may not be available yet and allows us to handle success and error cases separately with then() and catch() methods.
5. Async/await is a modern syntax that allows us to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous way.
6. Asynchronous code is particularly useful for programming situations where we need to communicate with external APIs and databases, or when we need to handle user events that might take a long time to complete.
7. Asynchronous code can be more difficult to debug and reason about than synchronous code, due to the lack of a linear execution path.
