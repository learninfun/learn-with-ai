Module bundlers are tools that combine multiple JavaScript files (modules) into a single file (bundle) that can be used in a web application. Module bundlers help to reduce the number of HTTP requests required by a web application, which can improve its performance.

An example of a module bundler is Webpack. Webpack is a popular module bundler that allows developers to create bundles with JavaScript files, CSS files, images, and other assets. Webpack analyzes the dependencies between modules and generates a graph that represents the hierarchy of the application's components. Based on this graph, Webpack creates one or more bundles that contain all the necessary modules.

Another example of a module bundler is Browserify. Browserify is a tool that transforms CommonJS modules into a single JavaScript file that can be used in a web browser. Browserify allows developers to use the same code on both the client and server sides of a web application.

Overall, module bundlers are essential tools that help developers manage the complexity of modern web applications and improve their performance.
