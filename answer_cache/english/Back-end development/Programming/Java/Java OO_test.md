1. What is inheritance in Java?
Answer: Inheritance in Java is the mechanism by which one class acquires the properties and methods of another class. It allows classes to be arranged in a hierarchical order, so that subclasses inherit certain properties from their superclasses.

2. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface in Java?
Answer: An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated, but can be subclassed. It can define abstract methods and contain concrete methods. An interface, on the other hand, is a collection of abstract methods and constants, but cannot define any concrete methods.

3. What is polymorphism in Java?
Answer: Polymorphism in Java is the ability of an object to take on many forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same type, as long as they implement the same methods or share the same interface.

4. What is encapsulation in Java?
Answer: Encapsulation in Java is the practice of hiding the internal details of an object from the outside world. It involves using access modifiers to control the visibility of class members and methods, and is a key component of object-oriented programming.

5. What is the Java inheritance hierarchy?
Answer: The Java inheritance hierarchy is a hierarchy of classes and interfaces, starting with the Object class, which is the ultimate superclass of all Java classes. The hierarchy then branches out into a variety of subclasses and sub-interfaces, forming a tree-like structure.
