1. Platform independence: Java code can run on any platform because it is converted into an intermediate format (bytecode) that can run on any platform with a JRE (Java Runtime Environment).

2. Object-oriented programming: Java is a purely object-oriented programming language that emphasizes on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

3. Memory management: Java uses automatic memory management through the garbage collector, which allocates and deallocates memory.

4. Robustness: Java is designed to be robust by including strong data typing, exception handling, and automatic memory management.

5. Security: Java provides a comprehensive security model that ensures that programs running under it cannot harm the system in any way.

6. Multi-threading: Java supports multi-threading, which allows multiple threads to execute concurrently.

7. Speed: While Java is not as fast as languages like C and C++, recent versions of the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and the use of just-in-time (JIT) compilation have made Java code faster than it used to be.

8. Large standard library: Java offers a vast standard library of classes and methods that simplify programming tasks.

9. Widely used: Java is a popular programming language in use in many commercial and open source software applications.

10. Community: Java has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development and support through forums, blogs, and open source libraries.
