Java is a high-level programming language that is used to create software applications that can run on different platforms. It is an object-oriented, class-based language that provides developers with a robust set of tools and features to build complex software projects.

Here's an example that illustrates the basics of Java programming:

```
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

This code creates a simple Java program that prints the message "Hello, world!" to the console. The program defines a class called `HelloWorld` that contains a single method called `main()`, which is the entry point of the program. The `main()` method uses the `System.out.println()` method to output the message to the console. 

Overall, Java's versatility and widespread use make it a popular choice for building a wide range of software applications, from web applications and mobile apps to enterprise systems and gaming platforms.
