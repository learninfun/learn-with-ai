1. Multithreading in Java allows for multiple threads of execution to run simultaneously within a single process.
2. Concurrency refers to the ability of different parts of a program to run independently and concurrently.
3. Java provides several mechanisms for multithreading and concurrency, including threads, locks, synchronization, and the concurrent collections API.
4. Thread safety is important in Java to avoid data inconsistencies and race conditions when multiple threads attempt to access or modify the same shared data.
5. Synchronization is used to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time, and locks can be used to control access to critical sections of code.
6. The concurrent collections API provides thread-safe versions of common data structures, such as lists and maps, that allow for safe access and modification by multiple threads.
7. Deadlocks can occur in multithreaded programs when threads hold locks and wait for other threads to release their own locks.
8. Thread pooling can be used to manage the creation and lifecycle of threads, improving performance and resource utilization in multithreaded programs.
