Serialization:

1. Serialization is about converting an object's state into a byte stream to be stored or sent over a network.

2. It can be used to save the state of an object at a point in time and then restore it later.

3. Java serialization is implemented by implementing the Serializable interface.

4. Serialization can be used to implement deep cloning, which is a way to make a copy of an object that contains references to other objects.

5. Serialized objects can be stored in files, databases or sent over a network.

Deserialization:

1. Deserialization is the reverse process of serialization, where a byte stream is converted back into an object's state.

2. Deserialization is achieved using the ObjectInputStream class.

3. Security is a concern when deserializing objects, as it can lead to the execution of malicious code.

4. Deserialization can be used to transfer objects across the network, share objects between JVMs or load persisted objects.

5. If an object's class changes between serialization and deserialization, it can lead to compatibility issues.
