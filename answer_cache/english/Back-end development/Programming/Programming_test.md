1) What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop in programming? 
Answer: A while loop checks the condition before entering the loop, while a do-while loop checks the condition after executing the loop at least once.

2) What is the difference between an array and a linked list in programming?
Answer: An array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations, while a linked list is a collection of nodes containing both the data and the link to the next node, stored in non-contiguous memory locations.

3) What is the purpose of a constructor in object-oriented programming?
Answer: A constructor is a special method used to initialize the state of an object when it is created. It sets the initial values of instance variables and performs any additional operations required to properly configure the object.

4) What is the difference between static and dynamic linking of libraries in programming?
Answer: Static linking is the process of including a library directly into the executable file at compile time, while dynamic linking is the process of accessing a library at run-time by loading it into memory as needed.

5) What is the difference between a stack and a queue in programming?
Answer: A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last element added will be the first one removed. A queue, on the other hand, follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle, meaning that the first element added will be the first one removed.
