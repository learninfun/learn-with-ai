1. What is the purpose of the Singleton pattern, and how does it work?
Answer: The Singleton pattern is used to ensure that a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it. It works by creating a private constructor and a static instance variable, and ensuring that only one instance is created by checking if the variable is null before returning it.

2. How do you implement the Factory method pattern in Java?
Answer: To implement the Factory method pattern in Java, you can create an interface or abstract class that defines a method for creating objects of a certain type. Then, you can create concrete classes that implement this interface or extend the abstract class, and provide their own implementations of the creation method.

3. What is the Observer pattern, and how is it different from the Publisher-Subscriber pattern?
Answer: The Observer pattern is used to notify multiple objects of changes to a single subject object. The Publisher-Subscriber pattern is similar, but allows subscribers to only receive updates for specific events. The key difference is that in the Observer pattern, observers register directly with the subject, whereas in the Publisher-Subscriber pattern, they register with a central event manager.

4. When would you use the Decorator pattern, and how do you implement it in Java?
Answer: The Decorator pattern is used to add new functionality to an existing object, without changing its class. This can be useful when you want to add features to a class that you can't edit, or when you want to add features dynamically at runtime. To implement the Decorator pattern in Java, you can create a Wrapper class that extends the original class, and adds new functionality in its methods.

5. What is the Template method pattern, and how does it work?
Answer: The Template method pattern is used to define the structure of an algorithm, but allow subclasses to provide their own implementations of certain steps. This can be useful when you want to enforce a certain order of operations, but allow flexibility in how each step is performed. It works by defining a skeleton method in the base class, which calls abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.
