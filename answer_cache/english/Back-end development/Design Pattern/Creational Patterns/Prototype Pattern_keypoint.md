1. Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows creating objects by cloning existing ones.
2. The pattern avoids creating objects from scratch, which can be expensive or complex.
3. It provides a way to create copies of an existing object without affecting the original object.
4. The pattern is useful when the creation of an object is expensive or time-consuming.
5. The prototype pattern can be used to clone complex objects that are not easy to create from scratch.
6. The pattern is especially useful when the creation of new objects requires substantial computational resources, such as when creating large datasets or complex diagrams.
7. In the pattern, a prototype object is created and then cloned multiple times to generate new objects.
8. The prototype object serves as a template for creating new objects.
9. The pattern can be implemented in various programming languages and is widely used in object-oriented coding.
10. One of the benefits of the prototype pattern is that it provides a simple and efficient way to create instances of a class.
