Creational patterns are design patterns used in object-oriented programming to help simplify object creation processes. They encapsulate object creation processes, provide flexibility in object creation, and promote code reuse.

There are five creational patterns, including the Abstract Factory pattern, Singleton pattern, Factory Method pattern, Builder pattern, and Prototype pattern.

An example of a creational pattern is the Singleton pattern. It is used to ensure a class has only one instance, while providing a global point of access. This pattern is useful in situations where only one instance of a class is needed throughout the applicationâ€”for example, a logging class, a database connection class, or a configuration class.

Here is an example of a Singleton pattern in Java:

public class SingletonExample {
  private static SingletonExample instance;

  private SingletonExample() {}

  public static SingletonExample getInstance() {
    if (instance == null) {
      instance = new SingletonExample();
    }
    return instance;
  }
}


This code ensures that only one instance of the SingletonExample class is created, and provides a global access point to that instance through the getInstance() method.
