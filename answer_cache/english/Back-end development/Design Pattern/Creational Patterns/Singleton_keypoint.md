1. Singleton is a design pattern used to create only one instance of a class in a program at any given time.
2. It ensures that the instance of the class is easily accessible from anywhere within the program.
3. The singleton class contains a private constructor that prevents the creation of multiple instances.
4. The singleton instance is created lazily, only when it is first requested.
5. It provides a global point of access to the instance of the class.
6. Singleton is often used when working with resources that should only exist once, such as a database connection or a system log.
7. It can help to conserve memory and improve performance by limiting the number of instances of a class.
8. The singleton pattern can be implemented in a thread-safe manner to prevent race conditions.
9. Singleton may be implemented as a static variable or as an instance variable in a class.
10. It is one of the simplest and most widely used design patterns in software engineering.
