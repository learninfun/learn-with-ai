1. Prototype is a JavaScript feature that allows developers to create objects with predefined properties and methods. 

2. It enables developers to add new functionalities to objects dynamically. 

3. It is used for faster and more efficient object creation. 

4. The prototype object acts as a blueprint for creating new objects. 

5. Every object has a hidden prototype property that points to its prototype object. 

6. The prototype chain is established when an object's property is not found in itself, and it searches for the property in its prototype object. 

7. A constructor function is used to create objects with a specific prototype. 

8. Developers can use the Object.create() method to create objects with a specific prototype. 

9. Prototype inheritance is a way of creating a hierarchy of objects where objects derive properties and methods from their prototypes. 

10. JavaScript libraries like jQuery heavily rely on prototype for building their functionalities.
