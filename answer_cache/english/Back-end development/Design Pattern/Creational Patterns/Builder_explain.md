Builder is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations. It allows you to create different representations of an object while avoiding repeating the same construction process.

For example, imagine a builder pattern for constructing a pizza. The builder pattern separates the construction of a pizza from its representation. You could have a pizza builder that you can give instructions to, specifying the toppings, crust, size, and other attributes. The builder would then construct the pizza based on the given specifications. Using this pattern, you can create different kinds of pizzas without having to repeat the same construction process every time.
