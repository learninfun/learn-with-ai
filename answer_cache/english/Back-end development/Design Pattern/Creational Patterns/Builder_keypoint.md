4. It provides a step-by-step process to create objects that can have different variations.
5. It allows for different parts of an object to be built independently and then combined together.
6. It improves code readability and maintainability.
7. It reduces the amount of duplicate code in the application.
8. It allows for greater flexibility and extensibility.
