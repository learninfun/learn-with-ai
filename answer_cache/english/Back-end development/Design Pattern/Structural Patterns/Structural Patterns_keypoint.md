1. Structural patterns provide solutions for organizing objects and classes into larger structures while maintaining flexibility and simplicity.

2. These patterns deal with the composition of objects and how they can be arranged to form complex structures, such as trees or graphs.

3. Structural patterns include three main categories: class patterns, object patterns, and composition patterns.

4. Class patterns focus on creating or altering class relationships to achieve desired behaviors, such as inheritance or proxy patterns.

5. Object patterns involve creating relationships between objects to simplify interactions and improve performance, such as adapter or decorator patterns.

6. Composition patterns involve constructing complex objects from simpler objects or promoting the independence of objects from their environment, such as composite or flyweight patterns.

7. Structural patterns can improve the flexibility and maintainability of code by separating concerns and facilitating communication between objects.

8. However, the use of structural patterns can also introduce additional complexity and reduce performance, so they should be used judiciously and appropriately.
