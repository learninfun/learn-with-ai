1. Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to treat a group of objects in the same way as a single object. 

2. The pattern organizes objects into tree-like structures, where nodes represent individual objects, and branches represent composite objects. 

3. Clients can interact with the composite object and its individual components using a common interface, making it easy to add, remove or manipulate the objects in the tree structure. 

4. The composite pattern enhances code reuse and simplifies complex hierarchical structures by providing a unified interface for both individual and composite objects. 

5. The pattern supports recursive composition where a composite object can contain other composite objects, allowing it to represent an entire hierarchy of objects. 

6. The composite pattern should be used when dealing with objects that form a part-whole hierarchy, where individual and composite objects are treated interchangeably. 

7. Examples of the composite pattern can be found in GUI objects, file systems, and organization charts where groups of objects are treated as a single unit. 

8. The pattern differs from the decorator pattern, which focuses on adding new functionality to an object, while the composite pattern focuses on organizing objects into a hierarchical structure. 

9. Implementing the composite pattern requires creating an abstract Component class that defines the common interface for all objects in the hierarchy, as well as the Leaf and Composite classes that implement the Component interface.
