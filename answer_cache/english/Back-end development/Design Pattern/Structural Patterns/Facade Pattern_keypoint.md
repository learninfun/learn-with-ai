1. Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simple interface to a complex system or set of sub-systems.

2. It simplifies the client interface by providing a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.

3. Facade Pattern is a way of simplifying code by hiding the complexity of the system behind a single interface.

4. It encapsulates the complexities of the system and provides a simplified interface that is easy to use and understand.

5. Facade Pattern promotes loose coupling between different components of the system, making it easier to maintain and modify the system in the future.

6. Facade Pattern requires careful design and configuration to ensure that the interface is simple and efficient, and that the system remains flexible and maintainable in the future.
