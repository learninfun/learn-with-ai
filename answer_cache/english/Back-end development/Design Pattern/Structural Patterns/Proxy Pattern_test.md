1. What is the Proxy Pattern?

Answer: The Proxy Pattern is a design pattern in software development that provides a surrogate object to control access to another object, called the Real Subject, which may be resource-intensive to create or support.

2. What are the main benefits of using the Proxy Pattern in software development?

Answer: The main benefits of using the Proxy Pattern include improved performance and scalability, increased security and reliability, and better separation of concerns.

3. What are the different types of Proxy Patterns?

Answer: There are four types of Proxy Patterns: Virtual Proxy, Remote Proxy, Protection Proxy, and Smart Proxy.

4. How does Virtual Proxy work?

Answer: Virtual Proxy creates a placeholder for a heavy and expensive object until it is actually needed. It acts as a buffer between the client and the real object, and is responsible for creating and initializing the real object when it is first accessed.

5. What is a common real-world example of the Proxy Pattern?

Answer: A common real-world example of the Proxy Pattern is a proxy server, which acts as an intermediary between a client and a server. The proxy server can cache frequently accessed resources locally, thereby reducing network traffic and improving performance. It can also provide firewall and authentication services to enhance security.
