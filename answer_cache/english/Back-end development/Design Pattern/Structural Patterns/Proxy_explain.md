A proxy server is an intermediate server through which client requests are processed. When a proxy server receives a client request from an internet-connected device, like a computer, it will forward that request to the target server. The target server then responds back to the proxy server with the requested information or resource, which the proxy server then relays back to the client device that originated the initial request. The use of a proxy server can provide several benefits, such as improved security, increased privacy, and better performance.

Example: 
Suppose a user wants to access a website, but the site is blocked in their location due to regional restrictions or censorship. In this scenario, the user can connect to a proxy server that is located in a different location where the website is not blocked. By doing this, the user's request will be sent through the proxy server, and the website will be able to respond back to the proxy server with the requested data or information. The proxy server will then forward that data back to the user. In this way, the user can bypass the geographic restrictions put in place in their location and access the blocked website.
