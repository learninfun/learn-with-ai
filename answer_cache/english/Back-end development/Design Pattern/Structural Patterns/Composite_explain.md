Composite refers to an object or structure made up of multiple parts or elements that together make a complete whole. In computer science, a composite data type is a data type that is composed of one or more simpler data types. 

An example of composite can be a basketball team, where the team is made up of players, coaches, and staff. Each component of the team contributes to the success of the whole organization. In programming, a composite data type can be an array or a struct. An array is composed of multiple elements of the same data type, while a struct is a composite data type that groups together variables of different data types under a single name. 

Overall, the concept of composite highlights the idea of creating a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts, by combining multiple elements or objects in a meaningful manner.
