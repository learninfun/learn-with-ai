1. Mediator is a behavioral pattern that helps to reduce the direct communication between objects. 

2. Instead of objects communicating with each other, a mediator object is introduced, which takes care of the communication between objects.

3. The mediator pattern promotes loose coupling between objects that need to communicate with each other. 

4. Using this pattern, the individual components of a system can be separated and reusable, making it more modular. 

5. Mediator improves the maintainability of a system since it reduces the complexity of the communication between objects. 

6. Mediator promotes extensibility since new objects can be added to the system without changing the existing objects. 

7. One of the disadvantages of the mediator pattern is that it can reduce the performance of the system since the communication between objects goes through the mediator. 

8. The mediator pattern is suitable for situations where there is a complex communication between objects, and it is challenging to handle direct communication between them.
