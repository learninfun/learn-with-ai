1. What is the Strategy Pattern?
Answer: The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables an object to change its behavior at runtime by selecting from multiple algorithms or strategies.

2. What are the key components of the Strategy Pattern?
Answer: The key components of the Strategy Pattern are the context, the strategy interface, and the concrete strategy classes. The context contains a reference to the strategy interface, which is implemented by the concrete strategy classes.

3. How does the Strategy Pattern differ from other patterns?
Answer: The Strategy Pattern is different from other patterns because it emphasizes the use of composition over inheritance. This means that the behavior of an object is determined by the composition of multiple objects, rather than the inheritance of behavior from a single parent object.

4. What are some common use cases for the Strategy Pattern?
Answer: Some common use cases for the Strategy Pattern include sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and database query optimization algorithms. These use cases involve multiple strategies that can be selected at runtime based on the specific requirements of the task.

5. How does the Strategy Pattern enable code reusability and maintainability?
Answer: The Strategy Pattern enables code reusability and maintainability by encapsulating each algorithm or strategy in a separate class, which can be reused in multiple contexts. This reduces code duplication and makes it easier to modify or add new strategies without affecting the existing codebase.
