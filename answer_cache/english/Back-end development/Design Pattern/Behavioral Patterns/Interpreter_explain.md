An Interpreter is a type of computer program that reads a program line by line and translates it into machine code or bytecode (machine executable code). Interpreters are often used for scripting languages and determine the instructions that the computer must complete by interpreting and executing each line of code.

For instance, Python is an interpreted programming language that is often used for scripting, data analysis, and data visualization. When you write a Python script, the interpreter reads it line by line and converts each instruction to machine-executable commands.

Another example is the JavaScript language, which is used extensively in web development. JavaScript is interpreted and allows developers to create interactive and dynamic websites. As the code is executed client-side, the browser's JavaScript interpreter reads the code in real-time, rendering it possible to see the output instantly.
