- Command is a pattern in software development that allows the separation of the requester of an action from the object that performs the action.
- The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
- A Command object typically includes fields or methods that store the parameters for the operation, as well as a method that executes the operation.
- The Command pattern simplifies the design of systems that require undo/redo functionality.
- The Command pattern can be used for a variety of tasks, from simple UI commands to complex business logic operations.
- The Command pattern promotes loose coupling between the sender and the receiver of a request, making it easier to maintain and evolve the system over time.
- The Command pattern can be combined with other patterns, such as the Factory Method or the Template Method, to create more complex, flexible systems.
