The Observer pattern is a design pattern that allows an object, called the subject, to notify a list of observers when its state changes. This pattern is widely used in event-driven systems, where one or more observers are interested in state changes of a specific entity.

For example, let’s consider an online store that sells products. Whenever the store receives new products, it needs to notify its customers. In such a situation, the Observer pattern can come in handy. Here, Store acts as the subject, and customers act as observers. Whenever a new product is added to the store, all the customers who have subscribed to the store’s notifications will be notified about the new product. The available products list is the state of the store, and the customer’s wishlist is an example of an observer that is interested in changes in this state. 

In this pattern, observers are decoupled from the subject, which allows for easier maintenance, scalability, and reusability of code. It also makes it easier to implement new functionality without disrupting current code.
