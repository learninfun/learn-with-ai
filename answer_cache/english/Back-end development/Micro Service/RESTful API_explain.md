RESTful API is an architectural style to communicate between different software systems over the HTTP protocol. It stands for Representational State Transfer. It is a lightweight approach to building web applications that uses simple HTTP requests to access and manipulate data.

In simpler terms, RESTful API specifies how different components of a web application should communicate with each other. In a RESTful architecture, every resource has a unique identifier and can be accessed through a uniform interface.

For example, a popular RESTful API is the Twitter API, which allows developers to use Twitter data in their own applications. Developers can use the API to programmatically access Twitter data such as tweets, followers, and user accounts. They can also post and update tweets using the API.

Using the Twitter API, developers can create their own applications that interact with Twitter data, such as social media analytics tools, Twitter clients, or apps that integrate Twitter data with other services. The Twitter API is a powerful tool for developers, and itâ€™s a good example of the power and simplicity of RESTful API design.
