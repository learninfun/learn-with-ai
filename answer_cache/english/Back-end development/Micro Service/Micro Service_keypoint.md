1. Microservices: Microservices is an architecture style wherein software is built as a collection of small independent services.

2. Service Independence: Each microservice is independent and can perform business or technical services required.

3. Easy Development, Deployment, and Scaling: By keeping each service independent, development is more comfortable, which results in quicker deployment, scaling, and reduced costs.

4. Fault Tolerance: Microservices provide better fault tolerance, with the ability to scale independently across all services.

5. Flexibility: Microservices support flexibility due to independent deployments that can be upgraded or fixed without affecting other services.

6. Decentralized Data Management: Microservices hold decentralized data. Each service has its data store unique to it, which prevents data redundancy, improves flexibility, and removes dependencies.

7. Technology Diversity: With microservices, each service can use different technology stacks based on requirements.

8. Continuous Delivery and Integration: Microservices architectures promote continuous integration and delivery, which enables quick and robust releases.

9. Good for Large-Scale Applications: Microservices are well-suited to handle large-scale applications by enabling them to break down monolithic applications into simpler, more manageable parts.

10. Code Reuse: With microservices, reusable modules can be created, which can be shared between different services.
