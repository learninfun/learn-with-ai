1. What is the purpose of RESTful API?
Answer: RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is designed to make communication between the client and server easier by using HTTP protocols to provide data and functionality. 

2. How does RESTful API handle sessions and authentication?
Answer: RESTful API is stateless, meaning it does not store any sessions or authentication data. Instead, it relies on authentication tokens that are passed between the client and server with each request. 

3. What are some common HTTP methods used in RESTful API?
Answer: The most commonly used HTTP methods in RESTful API are GET (to retrieve data), POST (to submit data), PUT (to update data), and DELETE (to delete data). 

4. How does RESTful API handle errors and exceptions?
Answer: RESTful API uses HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure of a request. For example, a 200 status code indicates success, while a 404 status code indicates a resource was not found. 

5. What is the difference between RESTful API and SOAP?
Answer: RESTful API is more lightweight and flexible than SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), which can be overly complex and difficult to implement. RESTful API also uses standard HTTP protocols, while SOAP requires its own messaging format.
