1. Q: What is Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) and how does it differ from traditional architecture patterns?

A: EDA is a style of designing software applications where the system responds to events triggered by user interactions or other sources. Unlike traditional architecture patterns, which rely on request-response interactions, EDA is asynchronous and allows for a loosely-coupled, scalable system.

2. Q: What are some common examples of events in Event-Driven Architecture?

A: Some common examples of events in EDA include user actions such as clicking a button, updates to a database or queue, incoming messages from external systems, and system errors or exceptions.

3. Q: How can an Event-Driven Architecture improve scalability and performance of a system?

A: By decoupling the components of a system and using asynchronous messaging, EDA allows for greater flexibility in scaling different parts of the system independently, reducing bottlenecks and increasing overall performance.

4. Q: What are some key challenges associated with implementing an Event-Driven Architecture?

A: Some key challenges include ensuring proper handling and propagation of events, managing event schemas and versions, maintaining data consistency across different components of the system, and monitoring and debugging event flows.

5. Q: What are some common tools and technologies used in Event-Driven Architecture?

A: Common tools and technologies used in EDA include message brokers and queues such as Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, and AWS SQS, event processing frameworks such as Apache Flink and Apache Storm, and APIs and protocols such as REST and WebSockets for exchanging events between components.
