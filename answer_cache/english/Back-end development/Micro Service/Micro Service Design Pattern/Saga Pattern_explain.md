Saga pattern is a pattern used to manage a series of distributed transactions so that they are completed consistently in the event of a failure. It is a sequence of local transactions that are coordinated by a central component called the Saga Orchestrator. Each transaction in the saga makes a change to the system and also publishes events that trigger subsequent local transactions, and it makes sure that all transactions are committed or rolled back.

Example:

Consider an example of an e-commerce application that involves a series of transactions including:

1. User places an order
2. Payment is processed
3. Order is shipped
4. User receives the order

If any of these transactions fails, then it could result in inconsistent data. With the Saga pattern, a sequence of local transactions is orchestrated to complete the entire process. If an error occurs in any of these transactions, then the entire process will be rolled back to maintain consistency.

For instance, the Saga Orchestrator checks to see if an order has been paid for, then it initiates a local transaction to process the payment. If payment is successful, the next transaction is shipped the order. If the shipping is successful, then the final transaction of notifying the user is initiated. Incase if any transaction fails, then it executes a compensation action to cancel the previous transaction, then it returns the system to its previous state.

This way, the Saga pattern ensures that all transactions are consistent and successfully completed, even in the event of a failure.
