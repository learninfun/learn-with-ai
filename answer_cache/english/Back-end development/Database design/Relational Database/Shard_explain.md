Shard refers to a small part or fragment of something that was once whole. In computer science, it is typically used to refer to a small piece of a larger distributed database. 

For example, a large online retailer might have a distributed database that contains information about all of its products, customers, and orders. This database might be split into multiple shards, with each shard containing a subset of the data. 

Each shard might be hosted on a different server, and queries for data would have to be distributed across all of the shards in order to retrieve the complete dataset. This approach can help to improve the scalability and reliability of the database, as well as reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred across the network at any one time.
