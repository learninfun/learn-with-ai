Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity. This is achieved through a series of steps called normal forms. Normalization ensures that each piece of data is stored in only one place, making it easier to add or modify data without creating inconsistencies.

For example, let's consider a customer database. In this database, we have a table called "Customer" which contains columns such as Name, Address, Phone Number, and Email. In the first normal form (1NF), each column contains atomic values (i.e. no multi-valued attributes). So, we would split the Address column into separate columns for Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code. This ensures that each piece of data is stored in only one place, making it easier to update and maintain.

Denormalization, on the other hand, is the process of intentionally breaking the rules of normalization in order to improve performance. This means adding redundant data to a table or denormalizing a table by combining multiple tables into one. Denormalization is often used in data warehouses or reporting systems where speed is more important than data integrity.

For example, let's consider a sales database. In this database, we have a table called "Sales" which contains columns such as Product ID, Sales Date, Unit Price, and Quantity Sold. We could denormalize this table by adding a column for Total Sales (i.e. Unit Price x Quantity Sold). This redundant data would improve performance by allowing us to easily retrieve the total sales for a given time period without having to perform complex calculations.

In summary, normalization is the process of organizing data to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity, while denormalization is the process of intentionally breaking the rules of normalization in order to improve performance.
