Query optimization is the process in which an SQL engine tries to optimize a query, or a set of nested queries, in order to improve their performance and decrease the time needed for them to execute. This involves evaluating how the query is structured, the data being filtered, the indexes being used, and other factors to find the most efficient way to retrieve the desired results.

For example, let's say we have a database with a large amount of data and we want to retrieve all the records for a specific date range. Here is a simple SQL query to accomplish this:

SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE date_column >= '2021-01-01' AND date_column <= '2021-12-31'

Now, the database engine will optimize the query to make it faster. First, it will look for an index on the date_column to make the search faster. If no index exists, it may decide to create one. It may also choose to cache the results of the query in memory to speed up future searches.

Another optimization technique may be to use subqueries to filter the data before performing the main query. For example, we could first retrieve all the records for the year 2021 and then apply additional filters like sorting or grouping.

By optimizing queries, the database engine can minimize the time needed to retrieve data and improve overall system performance.
