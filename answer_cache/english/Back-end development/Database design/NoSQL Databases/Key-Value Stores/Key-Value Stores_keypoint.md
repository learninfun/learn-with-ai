- Key-Value stores are a type of NoSQL database
- Each piece of data is stored as a key-value pair
- The keys are unique identifiers for the data
- The values can be any data type, such as strings, integers, or even more complex data structures
- Data can be retrieved quickly by the key, making key-value stores highly performant
- Key-value stores are highly scalable and can handle massive amounts of data efficiently
- They are commonly used for caching and session storage in web applications
- Key-value stores have limited query and indexing capabilities compared to relational databases.
