NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that are used to store and manage large and complex data sets. They allow for efficient and scalable storage and retrieval of unstructured and semi-structured data types, which include documents, graphs, and key-value structures.

These databases employ a distributed architecture that enables horizontal scaling across a cluster of nodes. NoSQL databases offer high availability and fault tolerance, as they are designed to handle large amounts of data and can easily accommodate changes in data structures without requiring a predefined schema.

An example of a NoSQL database is Apache Cassandra. It is a distributed, open-source NoSQL database that is designed to handle large volumes of data across multiple nodes. It uses a ring architecture that distributes data evenly across multiple nodes, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. Cassandra supports column-family data structures that provide efficient read and write operations on large datasets, making it ideal for use in large-scale big data applications.
