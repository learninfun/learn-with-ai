Document databases, also known as NoSQL databases or non-relational databases, are a type of database that stores and manages data in a different way than traditional relational databases. Instead of storing data in tables made up of rows and columns, document databases store data in flexible and JSON-like documents.

In document databases, individual documents can contain all the relevant data needed for a single transaction or task, which eliminates the need for complex joins or transactions. This feature makes document databases easier and faster for some types of applications, mainly those that require highly iterative, low-latency queries, like those used in data streaming, e-commerce, or social networks.

An example of a document database is MongoDB, a highly-scalable, distributed database designed for handling big data workloads in real-time. MongoDB is flexible, fast, and highly available, and it is used by numerous companies around the world, from startups to large enterprises, in a variety of fields, such as healthcare, fintech, logistics, and more.
