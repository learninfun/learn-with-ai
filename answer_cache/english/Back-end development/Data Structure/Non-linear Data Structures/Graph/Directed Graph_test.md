1. What is a directed graph?
Answer: A directed graph is a type of graph where edges have a specific direction or orientation, and cannot be traversed in the opposite direction.

2. What is the degree of a vertex in a directed graph?
Answer: The degree of a vertex in a directed graph is the number of edges that are incident to it, taking into account their directions.

3. What is a path in a directed graph?
Answer: A path in a directed graph is a sequence of vertices that can be traversed by following the direction of the edges, starting from one vertex and ending at another.

4. What is a cycle in a directed graph?
Answer: A cycle in a directed graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, and passes through at least one other vertex more than once.

5. What is a strongly connected component of a directed graph?
Answer: A strongly connected component of a directed graph is a subset of the vertices that can be reached from any other vertex in the same subset by following directed edges.
