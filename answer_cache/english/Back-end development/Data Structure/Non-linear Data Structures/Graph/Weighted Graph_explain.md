A weighted graph is a graph where each edge has a numerical value or weight assigned to it. The weight represents the cost, distance or some other relevant quantity associated with that edge. 

For example, consider a city with multiple bus routes connecting different locations. A weighted graph can be used to represent the bus network where the nodes represent different stops or locations, and the edges represent the bus routes. The weight on each edge could be the time taken to travel between two stops or the fare for a trip. With a weighted graph, we can use algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between any two stops or locations based on cost, time or some other relevant criterion.
