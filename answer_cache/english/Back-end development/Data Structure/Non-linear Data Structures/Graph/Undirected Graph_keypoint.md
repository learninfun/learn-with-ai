- An undirected graph is a collection of vertices (or nodes) and edges, where each edge connects a pair of vertices.
- In an undirected graph, the edges are bidirectional, meaning that if there is an edge between vertex A and vertex B, there is also an edge between vertex B and vertex A.
- The degree of a vertex in an undirected graph is the number of edges incident to that vertex.
- A path in an undirected graph is a sequence of vertices where each pair of adjacent vertices is connected by an edge.
- A cycle in an undirected graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, without repeating any other vertices or edges.
- An undirected graph can be connected or disconnected, depending on whether there is a path between every pair of vertices in the graph or not.
- A connected component in an undirected graph is a maximal set of vertices that are connected to each other by paths.
- The complement of an undirected graph is a graph with the same set of vertices, but with all the edges that are not present in the original graph.
- Many graph algorithms, such as depth-first search and breadth-first search, are commonly used on undirected graphs.
