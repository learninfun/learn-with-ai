1. Directed Graph is a graph whose edges are directed, which means that they have a direction assigned to them.

2. In a directed graph, each node has one or more edges pointing outwards, indicating the direction of the relationship between nodes.

3. Directed graph is used to represent a wide range of real-world applications such as social networks, flow networks, and web pages.

4. A directed graph can contain cycles, which can be defined as a sequence of nodes that lead back to the starting node.

5. The properties of directed graphs, such as connectivity and reachability, can be analyzed using algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

6. In a directed graph, the in-degree of a node corresponds to the number of edges coming into the node, while the out-degree refers to the number of edges pointing outwards from the node.

7. The shortest path between two nodes in a directed graph can be calculated using Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm, or Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

8. The complexity of algorithms for directed graphs can be higher compared to undirected graphs due to the added complexity of tracking the direction of edges.
