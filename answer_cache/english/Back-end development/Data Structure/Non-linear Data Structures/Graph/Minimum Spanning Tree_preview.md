1. What are the main applications of Minimum Spanning Trees, and how are they used in real-world scenarios?
2. How is a Minimum Spanning Tree defined, and what is the algorithm used to find it?
3. What is the difference between Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm for finding a Minimum Spanning Tree?
4. Can a graph have multiple Minimum Spanning Trees, or is there only one possible solution?
5. What is the relationship between the weight of a Minimum Spanning Tree and the total weight of all edges in a graph, and how can this be used to optimize network or transportation systems?
