Shortest path algorithms (SPA) are a class of algorithms used to find the shortest path between two nodes or vertices in a graph, which is a collection of nodes and edges or connections between them. The goal of these algorithms is to find the path with the minimum distance or cost, which can be defined in different ways depending on the problem being solved.

One of the most well-known SPA is Dijkstra's algorithm, which was developed in 1956 by Edsger W. Dijkstra, a Dutch computer scientist. This algorithm works by starting at a given source node and calculating the distance to all other nodes in the graph, exploring the graph in a wave-like manner. It maintains a set of visited nodes and a priority queue of unvisited nodes with their current distances from the source node, updating the distances as it finds shorter paths.

Here's an example of how Dijkstra's algorithm would work on a simple graph:

Let's say we have a graph with six nodes labeled A to F and the following connections and weights (distances/costs) between them:

A -> B (2)
A -> C (3)
B -> C (1)
B -> D (2)
C -> D (1)
C -> E (3)
D -> F (3)
E -> F (2)

We want to find the shortest path from node A to node F. We apply Dijkstra's algorithm step by step:

- Start at node A and set its distance to 0. Mark it as visited.
- Update the distances of its neighbors B and C to their weights (2 and 3) and add them to the priority queue.
- Pick the node with the lowest distance from the queue, which is B with a distance of 2. Mark it as visited.
- Update the distances of B's neighbors C and D to 3 and 4, respectively, and add them to the queue.
- Pick the next node from the queue, which is C with a distance of 3. Mark it as visited.
- Update the distance of C's neighbor D to 4 and add it to the queue.
- Pick the next node from the queue, which is D with a distance of 4. Mark it as visited.
- Update the distance of its neighbor F to 7 and add it to the queue.
- Pick the next node from the queue, which is E with a distance of 6. Mark it as visited.
- There are no more unvisited nodes in the queue, so we have found the shortest path from A to F with a distance of 7: A -> C -> D -> F.

Other examples of SPA include Bellman-Ford algorithm, which can handle negative weights, and A* algorithm, which is a combination of Dijkstra's algorithm and heuristic estimation to prioritize nodes that are more likely to lead to the solution.
