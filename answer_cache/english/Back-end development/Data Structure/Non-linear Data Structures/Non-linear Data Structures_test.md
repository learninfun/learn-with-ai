1. What is the difference between a binary tree and a binary search tree?
Answer: A binary tree is a non-linear data structure where each node has at most two child nodes, while a binary search tree is a type of binary tree where each node's left child is less than the node, and the right child is greater than the node.

2. What is the time complexity of finding the minimum element in a binary heap?
Answer: The time complexity for finding the minimum element in a binary heap is O(1).

3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a hash table as a non-linear data structure?
Answer: The advantages of using a hash table include fast lookup and insertion times. However, the disadvantage is that it can have collisions, which can lead to slower performance.

4. What is the difference between a stack and a queue?
Answer: A stack is a non-linear data structure where items are added and removed from the top, while a queue is a non-linear data structure where items are added at the rear and removed from the front.

5. What is a trie data structure used for?
Answer: A trie data structure is used for efficient searches of words or strings. It is particularly useful for storing dictionaries or for searching for words in autocomplete systems.
