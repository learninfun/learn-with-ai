1. Heap is a special type of tree-based data structure.
2. It is used to implement priority queues in computer science.
3. A heap can be classified as either a min heap or max heap.
4. In a min heap, the smallest element is always at the root and each parent node is smaller than its children.
5. In a max heap, the largest element is always at the root and each parent node is greater than its children.
6. Insertion and deletion operations in a heap have a time complexity of O(log n).
7. A heap is commonly represented as an array, with indices corresponding to parent and child nodes.
8. Heap sort is a popular sorting algorithm based on the heap data structure.
9. A binary heap is the most commonly used implementation of a heap.
10. A heap can be visualized as a binary tree where each node has at most two children.
