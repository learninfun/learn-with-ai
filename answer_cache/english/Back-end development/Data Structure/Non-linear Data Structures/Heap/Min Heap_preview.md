1. What is a Min Heap and how does it differ from other types of heaps?
2. How is the Min Heap data structure used in computer programming and algorithm design?
3. What is the time complexity of the most common operations performed on a Min Heap, such as insertion and removal of elements?
4. How do you implement a Min Heap using an array data structure, and what are some common algorithms for maintaining the heap property?
5. Can a Min Heap be used to solve any real-world problems, and if so, what are some examples of applications where it is particularly useful?
