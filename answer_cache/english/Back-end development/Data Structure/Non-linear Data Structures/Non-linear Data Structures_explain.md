Non-linear data structures are data structures that do not have a sequential or linear structure, and the elements are not arranged in a specific order. In a non-linear data structure, each item is connected to one or more other elements. The elements of a non-linear data structure may be arranged in a hierarchical, network, or graph-based structure.

Common examples of non-linear data structures include trees, graphs, and heaps. 

For instance, a tree data structure is a type of non-linear data structure that consists of nodes connected to each other in a hierarchical manner. Each node can have one or more child nodes, but only one parent node. An example of a tree data structure is a file system in a computer, where folders and subfolders are arranged hierarchically. Another example of a tree data structure is a family tree or organizational chart, where individuals or departments are represented as nodes connected through parent-child relationships.
