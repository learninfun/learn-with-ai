1) What is the time complexity for inserting a word into a Trie?
Answer: O(L), where L is the length of the word being inserted.

2) How is memory usage affected by the size of the input data for a Trie?
Answer: Memory usage will increase with the size of the input data, as a Trie stores the entire word for each node.

3) What is the difference between a Trie and a Hash table?
Answer: A Trie uses a tree structure to store keys, while a Hash table uses an array. Tries are useful for handling prefix matching and partial matching, while Hash tables are typically faster for exact matching.

4) How can you optimize a Trie for memory usage?
Answer: One optimization technique is to use path compression, which collapses single-child nodes into their parent nodes. This can significantly reduce memory usage.

5) Can a Trie be used for non-string data types?
Answer: Yes, a Trie can be used for any type that can be represented as a sequence of characters, such as numbers or binary data. However, a different data structure may be more appropriate depending on the specific use case.
