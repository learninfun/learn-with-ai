1. Trees are hierarchical data structures that store elements in nodes.
2. Each node in a tree has a parent and zero or more child nodes.
3. The topmost node in a tree is called the root node.
4. Nodes that have no child nodes are called leaves.
5. Trees can be used to represent relationships between data, such as family trees or organizational charts.
6. Different kinds of trees include binary trees, balanced trees, search trees, and B-trees.
7. Traversal of a tree involves accessing nodes in a specific order, such as depth-first or breadth-first.
8. Trees can be implemented in code using arrays, linked lists, or pointers.
