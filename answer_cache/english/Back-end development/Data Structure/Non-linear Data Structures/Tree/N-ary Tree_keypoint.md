1. An N-ary Tree is a type of tree data structure where each node can have more than two children. 
2. N-ary Trees can have any number of children, not just one or two. 
3. Each node in an N-ary Tree consists of a value and an array of child nodes. 
4. N-ary Trees are commonly used in computer science for representing hierarchical data structures, such as file systems or organizational charts. 
5. The depth of a node in an N-ary Tree is the length of the path from the root to that node. 
6. N-ary Trees are particularly useful when the number of children for each node is not known in advance. 
7. The complexity of searching, insertion, and deletion operations in an N-ary Tree is dependent on the number of children for each node. 
8. N-ary Trees can be traversed using various methods, such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS). 
9. Applications of N-ary Trees include decision trees, game trees, and computer networks.
