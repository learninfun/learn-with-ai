- A Huffman tree is a binary tree used for data compression.
- It is based on the concept of assigning variable-length codes to individual characters or symbols.
- The most frequently occurring symbols are assigned shorter codes as compared to the less frequently occurring symbols.
- The Huffman tree is built iteratively by merging the two lowest-frequency symbols into a new node until all symbols are included in the tree.
- The resulting Huffman tree is a binary tree with no branches containing only one symbol.
- The Huffman coding technique enables the compression of data by reducing the number of bits required to encode a message.
- The Huffman coding algorithm is widely used in data compression applications, such as ZIP files and MP3 files.
