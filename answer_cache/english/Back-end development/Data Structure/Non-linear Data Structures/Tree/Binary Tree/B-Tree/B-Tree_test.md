1) What is the maximum number of children allowed in a B-tree node?
Answer: The maximum number of children allowed in a B-tree node depends on the specific implementation, but is typically between 2 and 256.

2) What is the purpose of a B-tree index?
Answer: A B-tree index is used to speed up database searches and improve performance by organizing data in a balanced tree structure that reduces the number of disk reads required to find a specific record.

3) What is the difference between a B-tree and a binary tree?
Answer: A B-tree can have more than two children per node, while a binary tree can only have two children. Additionally, a B-tree is designed to maintain balance in the tree structure even as data is added or removed.

4) How does a B-tree handle duplicate values?
Answer: A B-tree can handle duplicate values by storing multiple copies of the same value in separate nodes or by using a linked list to store all occurrences of a particular value.

5) What is the worst-case time complexity for inserting a new value into a B-tree?
Answer: The worst-case time complexity for inserting a new value into a B-tree is O(log n), where n is the number of records in the tree. This is because the tree is balanced, so the number of comparisons required to insert a new value is always proportional to the height of the tree, which is logarithmic in n.
