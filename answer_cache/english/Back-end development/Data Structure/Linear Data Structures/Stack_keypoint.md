1. Stack is a linear data structure that follows LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
2. It allows inserting and deleting operations are performed at one end, known as the top of the stack.
3. The top of the stack is the last element added to the stack.
4. It is implemented using an array or a linked list data structure.
5. The basic operations of a stack are push, pop, top, and isEmpty.
6. Push operation adds an element to the top of the stack, pop operation removes the top element of the stack, top operation returns the top element without removing it, and isEmpty operation checks if the stack is empty.
7. Stack allows efficient memory management by allocating and deallocating memory in a structured manner.
8. It is used in various computer algorithms and programming languages for memory management, expression evaluation, and recursion.
