A linear queue is a type of data structure where the data elements are arranged in a sequential manner, and the addition of new elements is done from one end and the deletion of elements is performed from the other end. It follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle.

An example of a linear queue is a queue of customers waiting in a line to pay for their groceries at a supermarket. The first customer to arrive at the checkout line is the first customer to be served, and the last customer to arrive will be the last to be served. If a new customer arrives, they must stand at the end of the queue, and the customer at the front of the queue will be serviced and removed from the queue first. This process will continue until all the customers in the queue have been served.
