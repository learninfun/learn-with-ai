Linear data structures are data structures in which data elements are organized and accessed sequentially or linearly. The elements are arranged in a linear manner, such as in a straight line or a sequence.

Examples of linear data structures include:

1. Array: An array is a collection of elements of the same data type that are stored in contiguous memory locations. Elements in an array are accessed using their respective indexes. 

2. Linked List: A linked list is a data structure in which data elements called nodes are connected together via pointers. Each node contains a data element and a pointer to the next node. Linked lists can be singly linked, where nodes have a pointer to the next node only, or they can be doubly linked, where nodes have pointers to the next and previous nodes. 

3. Queue: A queue is a linear data structure in which elements are added at the rear(end) and removed from the front(front). The first element that was added to the queue will be the first to be removed as well. 

4. Stack: A stack is a linear data structure in which elements are added and removed from the top only. The last element that was added to the stack will be the first to be removed.
