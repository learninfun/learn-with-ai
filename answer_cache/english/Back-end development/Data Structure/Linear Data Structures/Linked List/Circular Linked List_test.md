1. What is a circular linked list?

Answer: A circular linked list is a data structure that organizes data elements in a circular sequence, where the last element points to the first element, forming a closed loop.

2. How is the insertion operation performed in a circular linked list?

Answer: The insertion operation in a circular linked list involves creating a new node, updating its pointers to link it with adjacent nodes, and updating the pointers of the previous and next nodes to point to the new node.

3. What is the advantage of using a circular linked list over a linear linked list?

Answer: One advantage of using a circular linked list over a linear linked list is that it allows for easy traversal from the last element to the first element without having to traverse through the entire list.

4. Can a circular linked list be empty?

Answer: Yes, a circular linked list can be empty, where the head/tail nodes point to null, indicating an empty list.

5. How is the deletion operation performed in a circular linked list?

Answer: The deletion operation in a circular linked list involves updating the pointers of the adjacent nodes to bypass the node to be deleted, freeing the memory space occupied by the deleted node, and updating the pointers of the head/tail nodes to point to the correct nodes in the list.
