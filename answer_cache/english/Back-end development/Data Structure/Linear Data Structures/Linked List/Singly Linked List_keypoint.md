1. Singly Linked List is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes.  
2. Each node contains two fields: data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.  
3. The first node in the sequence is called the head node, and the last node is called the tail node.  
4. Singly Linked List supports traversal in one direction only, from the head to the tail.  
5. Operations that can be performed on Singly Linked List include insertion, deletion, and searching for an element in the List.  
6. Singly Linked List can be used to implement various algorithms such as a stack, a queue, and a hash table.  
7. Singly Linked List is a dynamic data structure, and its size can be adjusted during runtime as required.  
8. Singly Linked List has a lower memory requirement than an array but requires more time for searching or retrieval of an element.
