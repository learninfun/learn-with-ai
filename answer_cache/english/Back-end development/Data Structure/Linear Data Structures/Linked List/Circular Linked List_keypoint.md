1. A circular linked list is a linked list in which the last node points back to the first node.
2. It is a dynamic data structure that is useful when the data items need to be accessed in a loop.
3. The operations that can be performed on a circular linked list include insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.
4. The circular linked list has a property of infinite size since it can continue forever.
5. Deletion of nodes from a circular linked list involves updating the links of the previous and next nodes to avoid broken links.
6. Insertion of nodes in a circular linked list involves updating the links of the previous and next nodes to ensure continuity.
7. A circular linked list can be implemented using a singly linked list or a doubly linked list.
8. A circular linked list can be used to implement circular buffers, memory allocation in operating systems, and round-robin scheduling.
