Windows is an operating system (OS) developed by Microsoft Corporation. It is designed to manage the computer hardware, software, and peripheral devices, and provide users with a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the system.

An example of using Windows is when a user turns on a computer or laptop, the operating system boots up and displays the desktop screen. From the desktop, the user can launch applications, access files and folders, connect to the internet, and customize settings. Windows also includes features such as Windows Defender for antivirus protection, Windows Update for installing updates and fixes, and Microsoft Edge as the default web browser.
