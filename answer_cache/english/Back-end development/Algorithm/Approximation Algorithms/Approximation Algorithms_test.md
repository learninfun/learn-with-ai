1) What is an approximation algorithm?
Answer: An approximation algorithm is an algorithm that finds a solution which may not be optimal but is guaranteed to be close to the optimal solution.

2) What is the worst-case performance ratio for an approximation algorithm?
Answer: The worst-case performance ratio is the maximum ratio of the objective value of the solution found by the algorithm to the optimal solution.

3) What is the difference between a constant-factor and a polynomial-time approximation algorithm?
Answer: A constant-factor approximation algorithm guarantees to find a solution within a fixed factor of the optimal solution, while a polynomial-time approximation algorithm guarantees to find a solution within a factor that is polynomial in the size of the input.

4) What is the Greedy algorithm?
Answer: The Greedy algorithm is an approximation algorithm that makes locally-optimal choices at each step in a way that leads to a globally-optimal solution.

5) What is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)?
Answer: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known optimization problem in which a salesperson must visit a set of cities, each only once, and return to their starting city such that the total distance traveled is minimized. Since it is an NP-hard problem, approximation algorithms are often used to find near-optimal solutions.
