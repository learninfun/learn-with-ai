1. What is Set Cover problem?

Answer: Set Cover is a well-known optimization problem, where we want to find the minimum number of sets needed to cover all elements in a given universe.

2. What is the simplest algorithm to solve the Set Cover problem?

Answer: One of the simplest algorithms to solve Set Cover is called the Greedy Algorithm, where we iteratively select the set with the largest number of uncovered elements until all elements are covered.

3. Is Set Cover a NP-complete problem?

Answer: Set Cover is a classic example of an NP-complete problem, which means that it is likely there is no efficient (polynomial-time) algorithm to solve it for all instances.

4. Can Set Cover be approximated within a certain factor?

Answer: Yes, Set Cover can be approximated within an approximation factor of ln(n) where n is the size of the universe. This is known as the ln(n) approximation algorithm.

5. What are some applications of Set Cover in real-life scenarios?

Answer: Set Cover has numerous applications in various fields, including logistics, networking, finance, and operations research. For example, it can be used to determine the minimum number of warehouses required to cover all client locations or to determine the most cost-effective advertising campaign to reach a certain target audience.
