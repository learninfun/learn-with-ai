The traveling salesman problem is a widely studied optimization problem where the objective is to find the shortest possible route that passes through a given set of cities exactly once and then returns to the starting city. This is also known as the Hamiltonian cycle problem.

For example, imagine a traveling salesman who needs to visit a set of cities to sell his products. He must start at his home (city A), and make stops at various other cities (such as B, C, D, E and F) before returning home. The challenge is to find the most efficient route that minimizes the total distance traveled.

The problem becomes more complex as the number of cities increases, since the number of potential routes grows exponentially. Finding an optimal solution to the traveling salesman problem is known to be an NP-hard problem, meaning that no efficient algorithm has been developed that can solve it for large datasets. Instead, various heuristics (approximation algorithms) are used to find near-optimal solutions.
