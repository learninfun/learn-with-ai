1. Modular exponentiation involves finding the remainder when a large number is raised to a power and divided by a smaller number.

2. It is commonly used in cryptography, as it allows for efficient encryption and decryption of data.

3. The basic algorithm for modular exponentiation involves iteratively multiplying the base by itself and reducing the result modulo the modulus, until the exponent is fully processed.

4. More efficient methods of modular exponentiation include binary exponentiation and Montgomery multiplication.

5. Binary exponentiation involves treating the exponent as a binary number and squaring the base multiple times until the desired exponent is reached.

6. Montgomery multiplication uses a special representation of the modulus that allows for faster modular arithmetic operations.

7. Modular exponentiation can also be used for various other applications, such as computing discrete logarithms and generating pseudo-random numbers.
