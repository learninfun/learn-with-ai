The Chinese Remainder Theorem is a mathematical tool used in number theory to solve congruencies in a faster and more efficient way. It states that, given a set of pairwise coprime integers m1, m2, ..., mk, and any integers a1, a2, ..., ak, there exists a unique integer x that solves the system of congruences

x ≡ a1 mod m1
x ≡ a2 mod m2
...
x ≡ ak mod mk

Moreover, this integer x can be found by computing the residues of the given ai modulo each mi, and combining them via the Chinese remainder theorem formula:

x = a1*M1*y1 + a2*M2*y2 + ... + ak*Mk*yk

where Mi = (m1*m2*...*mk) / mi is the product of all the moduli except mi, and yi is the inverse of Mi modulo mi. 

For example, consider the system of congruences

x ≡ 2 mod 3
x ≡ 3 mod 5
x ≡ 2 mod 7

Since 3, 5, and 7 are pairwise coprime, we can apply the Chinese remainder theorem. We have:

M1 = 5*7 = 35, y1 = 2 (since 35 ≡ 2 mod 3)
M2 = 3*7 = 21, y2 = 4 (since 21 ≡ 1 mod 5)
M3 = 3*5 = 15, y3 = 1 (since 15 ≡ 1 mod 7)

Thus, we get:

x = 2*35*2 + 3*21*4 + 2*15*1 
   = 140 + 252 + 30 
   = 422

Therefore, the unique solution to the system is x = 422.
