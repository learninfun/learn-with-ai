1) What is the worst-case time complexity of the Miller-Rabin algorithm for determining the primality of an integer n? 

Answer: The worst-case time complexity of the Miller-Rabin algorithm is O(k log^3 n), where k is the number of iterations performed to obtain a probability of error less than 1/4^k. 

2) How does the Miller-Rabin algorithm differ from the Fermat primality test? 

Answer: The Miller-Rabin algorithm is a probabilistic primality test that involves testing multiple bases and analyzing their results, while the Fermat primality test involves testing a single base and comparing the result to a predicted value. 

3) Can the Miller-Rabin algorithm prove that an integer is prime with absolute certainty? 

Answer: No, the Miller-Rabin algorithm can only determine the primality of an integer with a high probability of correctness. However, the error probability can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the number of iterations performed. 

4) What is the security parameter used in the Miller-Rabin algorithm? 

Answer: The security parameter is the number of iterations performed in the Miller-Rabin algorithm, which determines the accuracy of the primality test. 

5) Is the Miller-Rabin algorithm efficient for large integers? 

Answer: Yes, the Miller-Rabin algorithm is relatively efficient for large integers, with a time complexity that scales logarithmically with the size of the input. However, it becomes less efficient for very large integers (e.g. with thousands of digits) due to the large number of iterations that must be performed to achieve a high level of confidence in the primality result.
