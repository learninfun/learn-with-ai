Modular exponentiation is a mathematical operation that involves computing the remainder when a number is raised to a power and divided by a modulus. It is often used in cryptography and computer science to compute large values efficiently.

The formula for modular exponentiation is:

a^b mod n

where a is the base, b is the exponent, and n is the modulus.

For example, let's calculate 3^7 mod 5.

To do this, we first calculate 3^7:

3^7 = 2187

Then, we find the remainder when 2187 is divided by 5:

2187 mod 5 = 2

Therefore, 3^7 mod 5 = 2.
