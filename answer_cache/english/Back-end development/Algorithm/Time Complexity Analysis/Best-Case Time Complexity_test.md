1. What is the best-case time complexity of linear search algorithm?
Answer: The best-case time complexity of linear search is O(1) when the target element is found at the beginning of the array.

2. What is the best-case time complexity of bubble sort algorithm?
Answer: The best-case time complexity of bubble sort is O(n) when the array is already sorted.

3. What is the best-case time complexity of quicksort algorithm?
Answer: The best-case time complexity of quicksort is O(n log n) when the partitioning is balanced.

4. What is the best-case time complexity of binary search algorithm?
Answer: The best-case time complexity of binary search is O(1) when the target element is found at the middle of the array.

5. What is the best-case time complexity of merge sort algorithm?
Answer: The best-case time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n) when the array is already sorted.
