- Asymptotic notations are a set of mathematical notations that describe the performance of an algorithm in terms of its input size.
- The three most common notations are Big O notation, Omega notation, and Theta notation.
- Big O notation is used to express the upper bound of the growth rate of an algorithm, whereas Omega notation expresses the lower bound and Theta notation expresses both upper and lower bounds.
- Asymptotic notations can help us determine the efficiency of an algorithm and compare different algorithms for the same problem.
- The choice of notation depends on the specific problem and the level of precision required in the analysis.
