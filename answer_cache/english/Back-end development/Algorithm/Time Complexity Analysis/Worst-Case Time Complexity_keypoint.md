1. Worst-case time complexity is a measure of the maximum amount of time that an algorithm can take to complete, based on the input size.

2. It is determined by analyzing the algorithm's performance under the worst-case scenario, where the input data leads to the longest possible computational time.

3. The worst-case time complexity is expressed as a function of the input size, typically denoted by n.

4. Common worst-case time complexity notations include O(1), O(n), O(log n), O(n^2) and O(2^n), among others.

5. Algorithms with lower worst-case time complexity are generally more efficient than those with higher complexity.

6. Specific algorithms may have different worst-case time complexities depending on the input data, which makes careful analysis of an algorithm's performance crucial.

7. Achieving a lower worst-case time complexity often requires trade-offs between speed and memory usage or other resources.

8. Improvements in algorithms and data structures can lead to better worst-case time complexity for certain problems.
