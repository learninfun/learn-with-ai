Searching algorithms are computer procedures that are used by search engines to locate relevant information from a database or a list of values. These algorithms are designed to perform a systematic search for a specific piece of data within a large set of data. There are multiple types of searching algorithms, including sequential search, binary search, interpolation search, and exponential search.

An example of a searching algorithm is the binary search. Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that is used to locate the position of a target data value within an array or a list of sorted items. The algorithm works by first identifying the middle value of the array and comparing it to the target value. If the target value is larger than the middle value, the algorithm will eliminate the left half of the array and search the right half. Alternatively, if the target value is smaller than the middle value, the algorithm will eliminate the right half of the array and search the left half. The algorithm repeats this process until it either finds the target value, or it eliminates all possible values where the target value could be located. Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n) and is commonly used in programming when dealing with large datasets.
