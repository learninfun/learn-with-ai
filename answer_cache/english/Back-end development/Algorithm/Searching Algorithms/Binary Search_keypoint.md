1. Binary search requires a sorted list of elements.

2. It starts by dividing the list into two equal parts to find the midpoint.

3. It compares the value in the midpoint with the target value and decides which half to discard.

4. If the value in the midpoint is less than the target value, the left half of the list is discarded, and the search proceeds on the right half.

5. If the value in the midpoint is greater than the target value, the right half of the list is discarded, and the search proceeds on the left half.

6. This process is repeated until the target value is found, or until the search area is reduced to an empty set.

7. Binary search runs in O(log n) time, which is faster than linear search, especially for large datasets.

8. It is a useful algorithm for searching a specific element in a large sorted list efficiently.

9. Binary search is not suitable for unsorted or partially sorted lists.

10. Binary search is more efficient than linear search in terms of the number of comparisons required to find the target value.
