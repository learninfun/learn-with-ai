Binary search is a search algorithm that works efficiently with a sorted list or array. It searches for a particular element by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, until the target element is found or the search interval is empty.

Here's an example of binary search:

Suppose you have a sorted array of numbers: [4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40]

You want to find if the number 20 is in the array.

The general steps for binary search algorithm are:

- Compare the target value to the middle element of the array.
- If the target value is the same as the middle element, the search is successful and we return the index of the middle element.
- If the target value is less than the middle element, restrict the search to the lower half of the array and repeat the above steps on this half.
- If the target value is greater than the middle element, restrict the search to the upper half of the array and repeat the above steps on this half.
- If the target value is not in the array, we return "Not found".

Using binary search, you can start with checking the middle element of the sorted list, which is 20 in this case. Since the target value matches the middle element, the search is successful, and we return the index of the middle element, which is 4.

So, in this example, we were able to find the target value using only three comparisons, as compared to a linear search which would have taken 6 comparisons on an average to find the target value.
