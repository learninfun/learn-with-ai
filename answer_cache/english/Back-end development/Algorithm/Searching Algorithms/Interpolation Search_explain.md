Interpolation search is a search algorithm used to find an element in a sorted array by estimating its position through linear interpolation between the values found at two indices.

The interpolation search algorithm works by taking the position of the element in terms of its value relative to the start and end of the array. It then positions a pointer to the middle value of the array, and estimates the position of the element by projecting it along a linear path from the start to the end of the array, based on the relative value of the element being searched for.

For example, consider an array of integers:

[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]

To find the position of the element 50 using interpolation search, we would estimate its position as follows:

- Calculate the range of the array: (100 - 10) = 90
- Calculate the relative position of the element within the range: (50 - 10) = 40
- Estimate the position of the element using linear interpolation: (40 / 90) x (9 - 0) + 0 = 4.4
- Check the position against the middle value of the array: array[4] = 50

Thus, the element 50 is found in position 4.
