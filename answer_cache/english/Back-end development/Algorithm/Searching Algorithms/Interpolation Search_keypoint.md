1. Interpolation search is an efficient algorithm for searching for an element in a sorted array.

2. However, it does require that the array be uniformly distributed.

3. The algorithm works by estimating the position of the element based on the values of the endpoints and the target element.

4. The estimate is then used to determine whether the target element is in the upper or lower half of the array.

5. If the target element is not found, the algorithm repeats this process on the appropriate half of the array until the target element is found or the search is exhausted.

6. In the best case scenario, interpolation search can achieve a time complexity of O(log log n).

7. However, in the worst case scenario, where the array is not uniformly distributed or the target element is at the beginning or end of the array, the time complexity can be O(n).

8. Overall, interpolation search is a useful algorithm for searching sorted arrays, especially when the array is uniformly distributed.
