1. Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all vertices of a graph level by level, starting from the root or source node.

2. It works by visiting all the neighbors of the starting node, then their neighbors and so on, until all nodes in the graph have been visited.

3. BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to visit next. The first-in, first-out (FIFO) order is followed so the nodes at each level are visited before moving on to the next level.

4. BFS is often used to find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph, as it guarantees to find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed.

5. The time complexity of BFS is O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

6. BFS can be used to solve various problems such as finding the connected components of a graph, checking if a graph is bipartite or not, and identifying cycles in a graph, among others.
