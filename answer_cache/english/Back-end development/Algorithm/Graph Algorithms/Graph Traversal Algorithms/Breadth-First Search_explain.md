Breadth-first search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices in a graph or tree in breadth-first order. It starts at the root node and visits all the nodes at the current depth before proceeding to the next depth level.

For example, consider the following graph:

    A--B--C
     \ |
      \|/
       D

Suppose we start BFS at node A. We first visit A, then its neighbors B and D at the same depth level. Next, we visit the neighbors of B and D, which are C and B respectively. Finally, we visit node C, which is the only node remaining. The order of traversal is: A, B, D, C.

This approach ensures that all nodes at a particular level are visited before moving on to the next level. BFS is useful for finding the shortest path between two nodes or for traversing a tree or graph in a systematic order.
