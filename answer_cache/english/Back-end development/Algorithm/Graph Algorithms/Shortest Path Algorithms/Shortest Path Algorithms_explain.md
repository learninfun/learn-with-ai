Shortest path algorithms are algorithms used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. These algorithms are commonly used in fields such as transportation, network routing, and supply chain management.

One of the most common shortest path algorithms is Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm works by starting at the source node and exploring the adjacent nodes in order of their distance to the source node. As it explores each node, it updates the distances to all of its neighboring nodes, and continues until it reaches the destination node. 

Here's an example of how Dijkstra's algorithm works: 

Suppose we have a graph with nodes A, B, C, D, and E, and the following edges:

A -> B: 8
A -> C: 2
B -> C: 1
B -> D: 3
C -> D: 2
C -> E: 1
D -> E: 3

Our source node is A, and our destination node is E. 

1. Initialize all nodes with a distance of infinity, except for the source node which has a distance of 0. 
2. Choose the node with the lowest distance from the source node. In this case, it is node C with a distance of 2. 
3. Update the distances of all neighboring nodes. Node B now has a distance of 3 (2+1). 
4. Choose the node with the lowest distance again. This time it is node B with a distance of 3. 
5. Update the distances of all neighboring nodes. Node D now has a distance of 6 (3+3). 
6. Choose the node with the lowest distance again. This time it is node E with a distance of 7 (6+1). 
7. We have now found the shortest path from A to E, which is A -> C -> B -> D -> E with a total distance of 7.
