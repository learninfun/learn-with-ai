1. What is the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, and how does it differ from the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm?

Answer: The Edmonds-Karp algorithm is a variant of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for computing the maximum flow in a network. The main difference between the two algorithms is that Edmonds-Karp uses BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find the augmenting path, while Ford-Fulkerson uses DFS (Depth-First Search).

2. What is the time complexity of Edmonds-Karp algorithm to find the maximum flow in a graph?

Answer: The time complexity of Edmonds-Karp algorithm is O(V E^2), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

3. How does the Edmonds-Karp algorithm handle multiple sources and sinks in a network flow problem?

Answer: The Edmonds-Karp algorithm does not directly handle multiple sources and sinks in a network flow problem. To handle such cases, we can introduce a new source vertex s' and a new sink vertex t', and connect all the original sources to s' with infinite capacity edges, and all the original sinks to t' with infinite capacity edges. Then, we can run the Edmonds-Karp algorithm on the modified graph to find the maximum flow.

4. Can the Edmonds-Karp algorithm handle negative edge weights in a network flow problem?

Answer: No, the Edmonds-Karp algorithm cannot handle negative edge weights in a network flow problem. If there are negative edge weights, we can use the Bellman-Ford algorithm to detect negative cycles and then eliminate them or report that the problem has no well-defined solution.

5. How does the Edmonds-Karp algorithm ensure that it always terminates and finds the maximum flow in a network?

Answer: The Edmonds-Karp algorithm terminates because it always finds a shortest augmenting path (in terms of the number of edges) from the source to the sink in each iteration. Since the capacity of the augmenting path is strictly positive, the total flow increases by at least one unit in each iteration, until there is no more augmenting path. Therefore, the algorithm always terminates and finds the maximum flow in a network.
