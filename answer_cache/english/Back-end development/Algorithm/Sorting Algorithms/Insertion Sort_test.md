1) What is the time complexity of insertion sort?
Answer: The time complexity of insertion sort is O(n^2).

2) What is the basic idea behind insertion sort?
Answer: The basic idea behind insertion sort is to divide the input list into a sorted sublist and an unsorted sublist. Elements from the unsorted sublist are inserted into the sorted sublist in such a way that the sorted sublist remains sorted.

3) What is the worst case space complexity of insertion sort?
Answer: The worst case space complexity of insertion sort is O(1).

4) Can insertion sort be used to sort a linked list?
Answer: Yes, insertion sort can be used to sort a linked list as it uses a simple operation of inserting an element into a linked list.

5) What is the difference between stable and unstable sorting algorithms? Is insertion sort a stable or unstable sorting algorithm?
Answer: Stable sorting algorithms maintain the relative order of equal elements. Unstable sorting algorithms do not guarantee the relative order of equal elements. Insertion sort is a stable sorting algorithm.
