1. Quick sort is a popular sorting algorithm utilized to sort arrays.

2. It is a divide and conquer algorithm.

3. It sorts arrays by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the original array around the pivot element.

4. After partitioning, the algorithm recursively sorts the partitioned sub-arrays.

5. The sub-arrays are sorted in such a way that every element on the left side of the pivot is less than or equal to the pivot and every element on the right side of the pivot is greater than or equal to it.

6. Quick sort has an average case time complexity of O(n log n).

7. Its worst case time complexity is O(n^2).

8. It's a preferred sorting algorithm amongst researchers, engineers, and data scientists due to its efficiency.

9. Two significant factors affecting its overall performance include pivot selection and partitioning method.

10. Because quick sort requires recursive function calls, it can suffer from stack overflow, particularly with large data sets.
