1. What is the time complexity of randomized selection algorithm?
Answer: The time complexity of randomized selection algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.

2. What is the purpose of randomized selection algorithm?
Answer: The purpose of randomized selection algorithm is to find the kth smallest element in an unsorted array.

3. How does the algorithm select the pivot element?
Answer: The algorithm selects the pivot element randomly from the input array.

4. Does the randomized selection algorithm work with duplicates in the input array?
Answer: Yes, the randomized selection algorithm works with duplicates in the input array.

5. What happens when the input array is already sorted?
Answer: When the input array is already sorted, the performance of the randomized selection algorithm may decrease to O(n^2), which is equivalent to the worst-case scenario of the selection sort algorithm.
