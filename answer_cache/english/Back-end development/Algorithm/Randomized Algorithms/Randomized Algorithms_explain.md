Randomized algorithms are algorithms that use random numbers or probability distributions to solve computational problems. These algorithms use randomization to introduce creative ways of problem-solving that the deterministic algorithms may not be able to achieve. They offer several benefits such as efficiency for specific problems, practical solutions to compute challenging problems and robustness. 

One common example of a randomized algorithm is the Monte Carlo algorithm. This algorithm is used for estimating the value of the mathematical constant pi. The algorithm takes a square with a circle inscribed in it, and then randomly places uniformly distributed points. The algorithm then counts the number of points that are inside the circle and the number of points that are not inside the circle. By taking the ratio of the points inside the circle to the total number of points, the algorithm estimates the value of pi. The more points thrown, the closer to the actual value of pi the algorithm will get. The Monte Carlo algorithm is a randomized algorithm because it uses random numbers to solve the problem, making it an efficient approach to handle the ultra-high computational complexity of pi estimation.
