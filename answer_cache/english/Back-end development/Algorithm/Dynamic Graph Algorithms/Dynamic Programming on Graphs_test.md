1. What is the Bellman-Ford algorithm used for in dynamic programming on graphs?
Answer: The Bellman-Ford algorithm is used to find the shortest paths from a single vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.

2. What is the difference between top-down and bottom-up dynamic programming on graphs?
Answer: Top-down dynamic programming starts with the larger problem and breaks it down into smaller subproblems, whereas bottom-up dynamic programming starts with the smaller subproblems and builds the solution hierarchy up to the larger problem.

3. How do you define the optimal substructure property in dynamic programming on graphs?
Answer: The optimal substructure property states that any optimal solution to a problem can be decomposed into subproblems and their corresponding optimal solutions.

4. Can dynamic programming be applied to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)? If so, how?
Answer: Yes, dynamic programming can be applied to DAGs by using a topological sort to order the vertices and then computing the optimal solutions for each vertex in order.

5. What is a common problem in graph theory that can be solved using dynamic programming?
Answer: The traveling salesman problem, which seeks to find the shortest route that visits every vertex in a weighted graph exactly once, can be solved using dynamic programming.
