1. What is the shortest path algorithm used to find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted, undirected graph?
Answer: The Breadth-First Search algorithm (BFS) can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted, undirected graph.

2. In Dijkstra’s algorithm, the priority queue is initialized with the source node set to zero, and all other nodes set to what value?
Answer: In Dijkstra’s algorithm, the priority queue is initialized with the source node set to zero, and all other nodes are set to infinity.

3. What is Bellman-Ford algorithm used for?
Answer: The Bellman-Ford algorithm is used for finding the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a directed, weighted graph.

4. Which algorithm is used to compute shortest paths in a network where there are negative edge weights?
Answer: The Bellman-Ford algorithm can be used to compute shortest paths in a network where there are negative edge weights.

5. What is a drawback of Floyd-Warshall algorithm?
Answer: A drawback of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is that it requires O(n^3) time complexity, which can be too computationally expensive for very large graphs.
