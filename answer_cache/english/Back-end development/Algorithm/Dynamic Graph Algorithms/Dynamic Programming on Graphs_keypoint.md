1. Dynamic Programming on Graphs is a technique used to solve optimization problems on graphs.
2. The technique involves breaking down a graph problem into subproblems and solving them recursively.
3. The key idea is to use memoization, where the results of previously solved subproblems are stored and reused to solve larger problems.
4. The technique can be applied to various problems such as shortest paths, network flow, matching, and more.
5. It provides an alternative approach to graph problems that can be more efficient and faster than traditional algorithms.
6. However, it requires a good understanding of the underlying graph structure and problem, as well as careful implementation to avoid inefficient recursion and duplicate computation.
