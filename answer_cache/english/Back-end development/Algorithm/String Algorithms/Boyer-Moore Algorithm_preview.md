1. How does the Boyer-Moore algorithm differ from other string matching algorithms, such as the naive approach or the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm?
2. What is the significance of the "bad character rule" in the Boyer-Moore algorithm, and how does it help speed up the pattern matching process?
3. How does the Boyer-Moore algorithm handle patterns that contain repeating characters or substrings?
4. Can the Boyer-Moore algorithm be applied to search for multiple patterns at once, or is it strictly a single pattern matching algorithm?
5. Under what circumstances might the Boyer-Moore algorithm not be the best choice for string matching, and what other approaches might be preferable?
