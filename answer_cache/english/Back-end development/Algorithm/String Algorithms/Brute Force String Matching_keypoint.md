1. Brute force string matching is a simple algorithm that compares a pattern to a given string character by character.

2. The algorithm makes use of nested loops to compare each character in the pattern to each character in the string until a match is found.

3. If a match is found, the algorithm returns the index of the first character of the matching substring in the string.

4. In the worst-case scenario, the algorithm has to compare each character in the string to each character in the pattern. This results in a time complexity of O(mn), where m is the length of the pattern and n is the length of the string.

5. The algorithm is most suitable for small patterns or strings where the time complexity is not a major issue.

6. Brute force string matching may not be the most efficient algorithm for large data sets and can be improved with the use of more advanced algorithms such as Knuth-Morris-Pratt and Boyer-Moore algorithms.
