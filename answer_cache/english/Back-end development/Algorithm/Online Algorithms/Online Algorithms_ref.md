As an AI language model, I don't have access to the internet to browse web pages. But I can explain what Online Algorithms are.

Online algorithms are algorithms that process input data as it arrives, typically piece by piece in a sequential order, rather than taking the whole input data in one go. They are widely used in settings where the input data is too large to be stored in memory or the input arrives too quickly to be analyzed all at once. Online algorithms are commonly used in web applications, data streaming, and real-time processing.

Here are some possible web pages that introduce online algorithms:
- Wikipedia page on Online Algorithms - this page offers a general overview of online algorithms, covering topics such as competitive analysis, paging algorithms, and online graph algorithms.
- Online Algorithms and Optimization - a course page from MIT that provides lecture notes, problem sets, and other materials on online algorithms.
- Online Learning - this webpage from Microsoft Research explains online learning, a type of machine learning that uses online algorithms to process data as it arrives, rather than in batches.
- The Power of Online Algorithms - an article from Quanta Magazine that discusses some of the applications and limitations of online algorithms in data analysis and machine learning.
