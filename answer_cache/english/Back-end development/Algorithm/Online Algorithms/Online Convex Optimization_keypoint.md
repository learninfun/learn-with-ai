1. Online Convex Optimization is a technique used in machine learning algorithms where the data is provided in a sequential manner.
2. In Online Convex Optimization, the objective function is convex but unknown, and it is revealed only when a point is chosen.
3. The algorithm learns as it goes, using the information it has received so far to make predictions and update its model.
4. Online Convex Optimization algorithms operate on mini-batches, where a set of observations are used to update the model.
5. The algorithms are designed to optimize a convex loss function, which is why it can be used for a wide range of optimization problems.
6. Online Convex Optimization algorithms are robust to noise in the data, missing information, and changing conditions over time.
7. The applications of Online Convex Optimization range from online advertising to recommender systems, predictive modeling, and more.
8. Online Convex Optimization can be used in real-time applications that require quick decisions, such as autonomous cars, trading systems, and sensor networks.
