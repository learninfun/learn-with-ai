Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving a problem by trying out different solutions and undoing decisions back to an earlier stage if the current solution turns out to be wrong or unsuccessful. It is also known as depth-first search or trial-and-error problem solving.

The process involves sequentially following a decision path, examining the consequences of each decision made along the way, and reversing course if any bad consequences are discovered. This can involve undoing previous decisions or making additional decisions to correct the earlier mistakes.

Example: Sudoku Puzzle

In a Sudoku puzzle, we have to fill in each empty cell of a 9x9 grid with a number from 1 to 9 so that no number is repeated in any row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid. Backtracking can be used to solve the puzzle by trying out different numbers in each empty cell and backtracking to the previous cell if a number leads to an invalid state. The algorithm will continue until all the cells are filled with a valid number or all possible combinations of numbers have been tried without success.
