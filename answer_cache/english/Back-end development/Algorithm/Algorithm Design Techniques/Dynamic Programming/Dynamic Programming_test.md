1. What is dynamic programming and how does it differ from other problem-solving techniques?
Answer: Dynamic Programming refers to a problem-solving technique that divides a complex problem into smaller subproblems and solves each subproblem only once. It differs from other problem-solving techniques such as divide and conquer because it uses the solution of the subproblems to derive the solution to the main problem.

2. What is the difference between a top-down and a bottom-up approach to dynamic programming?
Answer: The top-down approach starts with the main problem and breaks it down into smaller subproblems, while the bottom-up approach starts with the subproblems and works its way up to the main problem. The bottom-up approach is generally more efficient since all the subproblems are solved once and then used to solve the main problem.

3. In what situations is dynamic programming useful, and when might it not be effective?
Answer: Dynamic programming is useful in situations where the same subproblems are encountered repeatedly and their solutions can be cached for reuse. It is not effective in situations where the subproblems are non-repeating or where the subproblem solutions do not contribute to the solution of the main problem.

4. Can dynamic programming be used for problems that involve non-linear relationships between variables?
Answer: Yes, dynamic programming can be used for problems that involve non-linear relationships between variables. However, the complexity of the problem will often increase significantly, as the optimal solution will require evaluating all possible combinations of subproblems.

5. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using dynamic programming over other problem-solving techniques?
Answer: The advantages of using dynamic programming include its ability to solve complex problems efficiently by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and reusing the solutions. Its disadvantages include increased memory and computational requirements, especially for problems with a large number of subproblems. Additionally, dynamic programming may not be effective in situations where the subproblems are non-repeating or have limited contribution to the solution of the main problem.
