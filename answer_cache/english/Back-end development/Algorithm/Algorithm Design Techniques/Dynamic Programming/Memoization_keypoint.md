1. Memoization is a technique to optimize the performance of recursive programs by storing the results of each function call in a lookup table.

2. By caching the results of previous function calls, memoization reduces duplicate computations and improves the overall efficiency of the program.

3. Memoization is particularly useful for problems where the same computations are repeated many times, such as dynamic programming.

4. Memoization can be implemented either manually or using built-in libraries and frameworks in different programming languages.

5. Memoization can also be combined with other optimization techniques like pruning and tabulation to further improve program performance.

6. Memoization is not always the best solution for improving program efficiency and can introduce additional overhead in some cases.

7. Developers should carefully analyze their algorithms and program requirements before deciding to use memoization as an optimization technique.
