1. Tabulation is a statistical technique used to facilitate the analysis of data by summarizing it in a convenient, easy-to-read format.

2. The process of tabulation requires the data to be organized into rows and columns.

3. The rows represent the categories or variables being analyzed, while the columns represent the values or responses associated with each category.

4. Tabulation can be done manually using a spreadsheet, or with specialized software designed for data analysis.

5. Tabulation can be used to analyze both qualitative and quantitative data.

6. Qualitative data can be tabulated using frequency counts, while quantitative data can be tabulated using statistical measures such as mean, median, and mode.

7. Tabulation is particularly useful for identifying patterns and trends in data, as well as for comparing data from different sources or time periods.

8. One potential limitation of tabulation is that it can obscure important nuances or details that are present in the underlying data.
