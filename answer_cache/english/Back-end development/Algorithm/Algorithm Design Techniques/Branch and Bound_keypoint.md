1. Branch and Bound is a problem-solving algorithm that is commonly used in optimization problems.
2. It works by dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems called branches.
3. Each branch is evaluated to determine whether it can be solved or not.
4. If a branch can be solved, its solution is recorded.
5. If a branch cannot be solved, the algorithm divides it into even smaller sub-problems, and the process is repeated.
6. As the algorithm progresses, it keeps track of the best solution found so far.
7. If all branches have been explored, the algorithm returns the best solution.
8. Branch and Bound can be used for both discrete and continuous optimization problems.
9. It can be used for problems in various fields, including operations research, computer science, and engineering.
10. The algorithm's performance depends on the size and complexity of the problem, as well as the quality of its relaxation function.
