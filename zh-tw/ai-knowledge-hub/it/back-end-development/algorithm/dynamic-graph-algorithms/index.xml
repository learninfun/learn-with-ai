給我5題Dynamic Programming on Graphs的問題 ChatGPT answer:
Longest Path in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): Given a DAG, find the longest path from a source vertex to a sink vertex. Shortest Path in a weighted DAG: Given a DAG with weighted edges, find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices. Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP): Given a complete weighted graph, find the shortest possible route that visits every vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.</description></item></channel></rss>
