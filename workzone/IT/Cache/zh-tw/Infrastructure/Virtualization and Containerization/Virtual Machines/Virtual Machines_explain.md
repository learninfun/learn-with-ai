Virtual Machines (VMs) are software emulations of computer systems that allow multiple operating systems (OS) to run on a single physical machine, each with its own set of resources. A VM runs like a standalone computer that emulates all the hardware and software services of a typical physical computer.

Virtual Machines (VMs) are beneficial for many reasons, including:

- Cost-efficiency: users can use the same hardware resources to run multiple OS, reducing the need for physical hardware.
- Compatibility: users can run applications on the guest OS that may not run on the host OS.
- Security: VMs provide a secure way to isolate different OS on the same machine, reducing the risk of data breaches.
- Flexibility: VMs provide an easy way to create backups, snapshots, and clones of virtual environments.

An example of a virtual machine is VMWare Workstation, which allows users to run multiple virtual machines( windows, Linux, macOS, solaris) on a single physical machine. Analysts, developers and Quality assurance professionals use it to test different software on different OS without requiring multiple physical machines.
