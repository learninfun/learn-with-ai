Docker is an open-source software platform that enables developers to easily deploy, manage and run applications inside containers. Docker containers are lightweight, standalone executables that encapsulate all the code, libraries, and dependencies required to run a particular application. By using Docker, developers can create a consistent runtime environment that guarantees that the application will work seamlessly across different hosts and operating systems.

One popular example of using Docker is for web application development. In a typical web application stack, the application code, web server, and database are all installed on the same machine. This can lead to issues such as version conflicts and configuration problems. By using Docker, each component of the stack can be packaged into a separate container, making it easy to deploy and scale the application. For instance, a developer building a web application can create separate Docker containers for the front-end, API, and database, ensuring that each component runs in the same environment regardless of where the application is deployed.
