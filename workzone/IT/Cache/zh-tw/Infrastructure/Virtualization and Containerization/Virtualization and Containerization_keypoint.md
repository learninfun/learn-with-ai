Virtualization:
- Creates a virtual version of a software or hardware infrastructure
- Allows multiple operating systems and applications to run on the same physical machine
- Provides flexibility and scalability, as resources can be easily added or removed from virtual machines
- Helps to reduce hardware and maintenance costs, as multiple virtual machines can run on the same physical hardware
- Can improve disaster recovery and business continuity by allowing quick backup and restoration of virtual machines.
- Requires hypervisor software to manage and allocate resources between virtual machines.

Containerization:
- Packages applications and their dependencies into containers for easy deployment and management
- Enables a consistent environment for applications to run in, regardless of the host or underlying infrastructure
- Offers fast and efficient application delivery, as containers can be quickly spun up and down, without the need for a full operating system or virtual machine
- Reduces infrastructure and maintenance costs, as containers can run on a single host machine, and many containers can run on top of the same operating system kernel
- Provides improved portability and flexibility, as containers can be moved between development environments, testing environments, and production environments.
- Requires containerization software to manage and orchestrate containers.
