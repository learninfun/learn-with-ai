1. What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)? 
A: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. 

2. Why is XSS dangerous?
A: XSS can be used to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials, and can allow attackers to hijack user accounts, spread malware, and perform other malicious actions without the user's knowledge.

3. What are the different types of XSS?
A: There are three main types of XSS: persistent, reflected, and DOM-based. Persistent XSS occurs when malicious code is stored on the server and executed when the user visits the affected page. Reflected XSS occurs when the malicious code is sent as part of a URL to the server, which returns it back to the user's browser. DOM-based XSS, on the other hand, involves manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page to inject malicious code.

4. How can XSS attacks be prevented?
A: XSS attacks can be prevented by properly validating and sanitizing user input on both the client and server side, setting appropriate HTTP headers, using Content Security Policy (CSP), and implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.

5. What are some common signs that a website is vulnerable to XSS attacks?
A: Some common signs that a website may be vulnerable to XSS include: unvalidated or unsanitized user input that is displayed on a web page, a lack of encoding or escaping of special characters, and the absence of measures to prevent or detect XSS attacks, such as CSP or web application firewalls (WAFs).
