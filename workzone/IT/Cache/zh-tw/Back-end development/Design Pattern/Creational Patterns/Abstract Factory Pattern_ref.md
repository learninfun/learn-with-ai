https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abstract-factory-design-pattern/

The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that lets you create a family of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is useful when you want to produce objects that are related in some way, such as a set of UI controls that have the same appearance and behavior.

The Abstract Factory Pattern is a design pattern that abstracts the process of creating objects. Instead of instantiating objects directly, the pattern defines an interface for creating them and leave the implementation to subclasses. It is useful when you want to provide a way to create a family of objects that work together.

The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides a way to encapsulate a group of related objects into a single unit. The pattern defines an interface for creating objects, but the actual implementation of those objects is left to subclasses. It is useful when you want to create objects that are related in some way, such as a set of controls in a graphical user interface.

The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that separates the process of creating objects from the client code that uses them. It provides an interface for creating families of related objects, but the actual implementation of those objects is left to subclasses. It is useful when you want to create objects that have the same behavior, but differ in some way, such as different types of database connections.

The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. The pattern defines a factory interface that encapsulates the creation of objects, and the client code that uses the objects can work with them without knowing their concrete classes. It is useful when you want to create objects that work together, but don't want to know the details of how they are created.
