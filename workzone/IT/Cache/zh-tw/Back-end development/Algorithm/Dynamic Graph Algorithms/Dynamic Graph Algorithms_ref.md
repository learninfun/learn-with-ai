This paper presents a dynamic algorithm for maintaining connectivity in directed graphs, where edges can be inserted or deleted dynamically over time. The algorithm has a complexity of O(log^2 n) per update and O(1) query time.

2. "Dynamic Graph Algorithms for Optimization Problems" by A. Gamst and R. E. Tarjan. This paper presents dynamic algorithms for solving optimization problems on graphs, such as minimum spanning trees, shortest paths, and maximum flows. The algorithms have a complexity of O(log^2 n) per update and O(1) query time.

3. "Dynamic Graph Algorithms for All-Pairs Shortest Paths" by Y. Zwick. This paper presents a dynamic algorithm for maintaining all-pairs shortest paths in directed graphs, where edges can be inserted or deleted dynamically over time. The algorithm achieves a complexity of O(n^2 log n) per update and O(1) query time.

4. "Dynamic Graph Algorithms for Dominators and Related Problems" by P. B. Miltersen and U. V. Vazirani. This paper presents dynamic algorithms for maintaining dominator trees and related data structures in directed graphs, where edges can be inserted or deleted dynamically over time. The algorithms have a complexity of O(log n) per update and O(1) query time.

5. "Dynamic Graph Algorithms for Minimum Cut and Maximum Flow" by S. Sankowski and C. Stein. This paper presents dynamic algorithms for maintaining minimum cuts and maximum flows in undirected graphs, where edges can be inserted or deleted dynamically over time. The algorithms have a complexity of O(min(n^2/3, m)) per update and O(1) query time.
