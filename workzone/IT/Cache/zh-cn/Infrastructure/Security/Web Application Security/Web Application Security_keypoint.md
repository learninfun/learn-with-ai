1. Authentication and Authorization: The first key point of web application security is proper authentication and authorization. This involves verifying the identity of users and limiting access to protected information to authorized individuals only.
2. Secure Coding Practices: Secure coding practices ensure that a web application is built with security in mind. This includes the use of secure development frameworks and libraries, testing code for vulnerabilities, and adhering to industry standards and best practices.
3. Input Validation: Input validation is the practice of checking the validity of data that a web application receives from users. This helps to prevent malicious code such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
4. Access Controls: Proper access controls enable administrators to limit which users have access to sensitive data or functions within a web application. This can include role-based access control, time-based access control, and the use of privileged accounts.
5. Session Management: A web application should properly manage user sessions to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. This involves the use of secure session tokens, expiring sessions after a certain time, and preventing session hijacking.
6. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection: CSRF attacks allow an attacker to impersonate a user and execute actions within a web application without the userâ€™s knowledge or consent. Proper CSRF protection includes the use of anti-CSRF tokens, which verify that a request is legitimate and not forged.
7. Data Protection: Web applications must protect sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII) and financial data, from unauthorized access or disclosure. This involves the use of encryption, data masking, and secure storage practices.
8. Threat Detection and Response: Web applications must be continuously monitored for security threats and vulnerabilities. This includes the use of intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) and logging suspicious activity to respond quickly to security incidents.
