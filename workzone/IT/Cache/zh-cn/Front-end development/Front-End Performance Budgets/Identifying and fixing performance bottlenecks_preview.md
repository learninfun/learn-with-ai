1. What are some common causes of performance bottlenecks in software applications, and how can they be identified? 

2. What tools or techniques can developers use to monitor application performance and identify specific areas that may be causing bottlenecks? 

3. Once a bottleneck has been identified, what steps can be taken to address it and improve application performance? 

4. Are there any best practices or guidelines that developers can follow to avoid introducing performance bottlenecks in the first place? 

5. How can performance testing be used to identify potential bottlenecks before an application is released to production, and what are some common testing strategies or tools that can be used for this purpose?
