1. What is the main advantage of using Prim's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree over Kruskal's algorithm?
2. How does Kruskal's algorithm ensure that the minimum spanning tree is found?
3. Under what circumstances would a Boruvka's algorithm be preferable over other Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms?
4. How does the complexity of Prim's algorithm vary with the size of the input graph?
5. Can a Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm be used to solve other classes of problems besides minimum spanning trees? If so, give an example.
