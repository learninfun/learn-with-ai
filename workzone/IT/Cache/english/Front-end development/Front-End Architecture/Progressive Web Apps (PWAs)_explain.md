Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that use modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users. PWAs work across all devices and platforms, providing users with a seamless and engaging experience.

PWAs are built with standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and are designed to be reliable, fast, and responsive, even when users are offline. They are installable, provide push notifications, and are discoverable, meaning they can be indexed by search engines.

An example of a PWA is Twitter Lite. Twitter Lite is a PWA that offers all the functionality of the Twitter app, but with a smaller file size and faster loading times. The PWA also allows users to use the app while offline and sends push notifications, just like the native app. Twitter Lite has been successful in countries where users have limited internet connectivity and slower devices, making it a popular alternative to the native app.
