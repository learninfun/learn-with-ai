1. Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern for creating software applications that separates the concerns of the application into separate components.

2. The Model component is responsible for managing the data and state of the application.

3. The View component is responsible for presenting the data to users and for handling user input.

4. The Controller component is responsible for handling user input and interacting with the Model to update the data and state of the application.

5. The separation of concerns provided by the MVC pattern makes it easier to modify and extend applications without affecting other parts of the system.

6. MVC is widely used in web development as it allows for the separation of the backend data and logic from the frontend presentation layer.

7. Many popular web frameworks, such as Ruby on Rails and Django, are built on an MVC architecture.

8. MVC is also used in desktop and mobile application development, game development, and other software development domains.
