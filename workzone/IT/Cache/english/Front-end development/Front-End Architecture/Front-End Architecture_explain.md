Front-end architecture refers to the overall design and structure of the client-side components of a web or mobile application. It includes everything that a user sees and interacts with, such as the user interface, layout, and navigation.

The key aspects of front-end architecture are how the code is organized, how data is managed, and how the components use and interact with each other.

One example of front-end architecture is the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. In MVC architecture, the model represents the data and business logic, the view is responsible for rendering the user interface, and the controller manages the communication between the model and view.

For instance, if you are creating a calendar application, the model would store the calendar data (dates, events, reminders), the view would display the calendar layout, and the controller would handle the userâ€™s input (e.g., selecting a date or creating an event). By separating these concerns, the MVC pattern ensures a clear and organized structure that makes it easier to maintain and scale the application over time.
