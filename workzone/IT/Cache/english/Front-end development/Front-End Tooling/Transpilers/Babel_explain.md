Babel is a JavaScript compiler that converts modern JavaScript code into more compatible versions that can be run by older browsers. Essentially, it helps developers write code using the latest syntax and features, without worrying about whether the code will run on all browsers.

For example, if a developer writes code using the latest ES6 syntax (const, let, arrow functions, etc.), it may not work on older browsers like Internet Explorer without Babel's help. By running the code through Babel, it can be transformed into a version that uses older syntax and is compatible with all browsers. 

Overall, Babel helps developers write cleaner and more efficient code, while ensuring that it works across all platforms and browsers.
