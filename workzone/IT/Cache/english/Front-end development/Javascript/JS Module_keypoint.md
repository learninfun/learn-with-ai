- Modules are a way of organizing code in JavaScript to make it more modular and reusable.
- Modules offer encapsulation, so that variables and functions inside a module are not accessible outside the module, preventing naming collisions and other issues.
- There are two types of modules: ES6 modules and CommonJS modules.
- ES6 modules use the `import` and `export` keywords to define and use modules.
- CommonJS modules use the `require()` function to load modules and the `module.exports` object to define modules.
- Modules can be used to load other modules, making it easy to build complex applications from smaller, reusable parts.
- Modules are an important part of modern JavaScript development, and many libraries and frameworks rely on them to organize code and facilitate collaboration.
