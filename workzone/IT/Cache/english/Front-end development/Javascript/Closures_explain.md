Closures are functions in JavaScript that are created inside other functions and have access to the parent function's parameters and variables. They allow for functions to maintain references to the original state of inside the parent function and can modify that state without compromising the state of other code that may rely on the same state.

Here is an example of a closure in JavaScript:

```javascript
function counter() {
  let count = 0;
  function increment() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  }
  return increment;
}

const count = counter();
count(); // 1
count(); // 2
count(); // 3
```

In this example, the `counter` function creates a local variable `count` and returns an inner function `increment`. The `increment` function uses the `count` variable from the parent scope and modifies it. The `counter` function returns the `increment` function, which is assigned to the `count` variable. When `count` is called, it has access to the original `count` variable from the parent function, and updates it accordingly.

Overall, closures are a powerful tool in JavaScript for maintaining private state within functions, which can help prevent unexpected behavior and bugs in complex code.
