JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is widely used for developing interactive web pages and web applications. JavaScript is executed in the browser and can manipulate HTML and CSS to create dynamic pages. It also allows for the creation of interactive features and effects like animations, pop-up boxes, and other user interactions.

One example of JavaScript in action is the Google Maps API, which uses JavaScript to display maps, markers, and other features. With Google Maps, users can navigate and interact with interactive maps, searching for directions, and zooming in and out of maps. Another example is online forms that use JavaScript to validate input fields, check for errors, and provide feedback to the user.
