1. Code splitting is a technique to divide code into smaller chunks to reduce the initial load time of the application.

2. By splitting the code, the application can load just the necessary code required to render the current page, instead of loading the entire application all at once.

3. Code splitting can be done in various ways such as using dynamic imports, webpack, or third-party libraries like Loadable Components.

4. It's suitable for larger applications that have a lot of code, and where it's important to provide a smooth and fast user experience, especially on slow internet connections.

5. Code splitting can also reduce the speed of testing and deployment, as developers can test smaller chunks of code, and deploy only the changes without affecting the entire application.

6. It can also help in optimizing and improving the application's performance by reducing the size of the code, and making it more efficient. 

7. The technique can also help in developing modular, maintainable, and scalable applications by enabling developers to separate code based on features, components, pages, and other logical entities.
