Front-end optimization refers to the process of improving the performance and efficiency of a website or application by optimizing its front-end components, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.

One example of front-end optimization is minification, which involves removing unnecessary characters from the code without altering its functionality. This reduces the size of the files, allowing them to load faster and improving the overall page load time. Another example is lazy loading, which means delaying the loading of non-critical resources until they are actually needed, thereby reducing the initial page load time. Additionally, image optimization is also an important factor in front-end optimization, as it involves compressing images and reducing their size without compromising on the quality. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred, leading to faster loading times.
