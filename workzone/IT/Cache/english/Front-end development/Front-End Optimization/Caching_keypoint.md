1. Caching refers to the process of storing frequently accessed data in a temporary storage area, such as memory or disk, to reduce data retrieval time.

2. The purpose of caching is to improve performance, scalability, and availability of applications by reducing data access latency, network traffic and server load.

3. The two main types of caching are client-side caching and server-side caching.

4. Client-side caching uses web browser caching or proxy caching to store frequently accessed web pages, images, scripts, and stylesheets on the user's local machine.

5. Server-side caching uses a caching layer, such as Memcached or Redis, to store frequently accessed data, such as session data, database queries, or API responses, in memory.

6. Cache invalidation is the process of removing or updating cached data when the source data changes or expires.

7. Cache expiration policies, such as time-based or event-based invalidation, determine when cached data should be removed or refreshed.

8. Cache invalidation and expiration can be challenging, as it requires coordination between multiple layers of the application stack and may result in stale or inconsistent data.

9. Despite its challenges, caching is a critical technique for optimizing web performance and enabling high-traffic, high-volume applications.
