2. CDNs optimize content delivery by reducing network latency and improving page load speed.

3. CDNs use caching to store frequently accessed static content in multiple locations worldwide, reducing server load and improving performance.

4. CDNs offer high scalability, security, and reliability to handle large amounts of traffic spikes and ensure availability and accessibility.

5. CDNs reduce bandwidth costs by serving content from the nearest servers, minimizing data transfers between different geographies.
