1. What is database normalization and why is it important?

Answer: Database normalization is the process of organizing data in a relational database in order to eliminate redundant information and ensure data integrity. It is important because it helps to reduce the risk of data anomalies, improves data consistency, and makes it easier to maintain and modify the database.

2. What are the three normal forms of database normalization and how do they differ?

Answer: The three normal forms of database normalization are 1NF (first normal form), 2NF (second normal form), and 3NF (third normal form). Each normal form builds on the previous one to further eliminate redundancy and ensure data consistency. In 1NF, each table cell contains only atomic values. In 2NF, all non-key attributes are dependent on the primary key. In 3NF, every non-key attribute is dependent on the primary key or another non-key attribute.

3. What is denormalization and when is it used?

Answer: Denormalization is the process of intentionally adding redundancy to a database in order to improve performance. It is used when there are read-heavy workloads, complex queries, or large data sets. By denormalizing data, it can be accessed more quickly and efficiently, but it can also increase the risk of data inconsistencies and make it more difficult to maintain the database.

4. What are some common denormalization techniques?

Answer: Some common denormalization techniques include creating summary tables or materialized views, adding calculated columns or indexing frequently used queries, partitioning large tables, and duplicating data across multiple tables or databases. Each technique has its own benefits and drawbacks and should be carefully evaluated for the specific needs of the database.

5. How can normalization and denormalization be balanced in a database design?

Answer: In order to balance normalization and denormalization in a database design, it is important to consider the specific needs of the application and its users. Normalization should be used to ensure data consistency and reduce the risk of anomalies, while denormalization should be used to improve performance and scalability. A carefully designed database should strike a balance between these two goals, keeping in mind the trade-offs and constraints of each approach.
