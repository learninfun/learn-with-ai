Normalization:

1. Organizes data in a structured way to reduce redundancy.
2. Helps in storing and managing the data efficiently.
3. Minimizes data anomalies and inconsistencies.
4. Follows a set of rules through normal forms, including 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, and 4NF.
5. Promotes data integrity and accuracy.
6. Enables easier database updates, deletes and data retrieval.
7. Results in better performance when modifying data, querying data or joining tables.

Denormalization:

1. Reverses the process of normalization by reintroducing redundancy into the database.
2. Used to improve database performance by reducing the number of joins needed for data retrieval.
3. Increases query speed by avoiding table joins and reducing the time required to retrieve data.
4. Helps in simplifying and optimizing complex queries.
5. Increases storage space requirements due to data redundancy.
6. Makes the database system more complex, which in turn may affect data integrity.
7. Should be used cautiously as it can lead to data inconsistencies and unexpected results.
