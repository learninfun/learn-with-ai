1. What is query optimization?
Answer: Query optimization is the process of optimizing the performance of a database query by selecting the most efficient execution plan.

2. What are the common techniques used in query optimization?
Answer: Query optimization can be achieved through techniques such as indexes, query rewriting, join ordering, and materialized views.

3. How can indexes improve query performance?
Answer: Indexes can improve query performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned during a query. This is achieved by creating an index on a column or set of columns that frequently appear in WHERE or JOIN clauses.

4. Why is join ordering important in query optimization?
Answer: Join ordering is important in query optimization because it can significantly affect query performance. The order in which tables are joined can impact the efficiency of the query execution plan.

5. What are the limitations of query optimization?
Answer: While query optimization can improve query performance, it has limitations such as the complexity and size of the database, the types of queries being executed, and the hardware and software resources available. Additionally, query optimization may require a high level of expertise and resources, making it difficult or expensive to implement in some cases.
