Database design refers to the process of creating a blueprint or a representation of a database. It involves the systematic and organized arrangement of data entities, attributes, and relationships to ensure easy access, efficient data management, and data integrity. The design process takes into account the specific needs of the organization, the types of data that will be stored, and how the data will be used.

An example of database design could be creating a database for an online store that sells various products. The database would have tables for products, customers, orders, and shipping information. Each table would have fields for specific data such as product name, price, quantity, customer ID, order date, shipping address, etc. The relationships between the tables would be established by the use of foreign keys. For example, each order would be linked to a specific customer through their unique ID. This design would allow the store to manage their products, track customer orders, and ensure efficient and accurate shipping.
