1. Spring Boot is a framework that provides a set of tools and utilities for building web applications quickly and efficiently.
2. Spring Boot is designed to simplify the development process by providing a modular and auto-configurable approach to building applications.
3. Spring Boot utilizes Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow as its embedded web server, which eliminates the need for standalone web servers.
4. Spring Boot is built on the Spring framework, which provides support for a wide range of functionality including dependency injection, MVC, data access, and more.
5. Spring Boot provides several built-in features, such as metrics gathering, health checking, and externalized configuration, that make it easier to build and maintain complex applications.
6. Spring Boot follows a “convention over configuration” approach, which means that developers don’t need to spend time setting up configuration files and can focus more on writing code.
7. Spring Boot enables developers to create standalone, production-ready applications that can be deployed directly to a cloud environment.
8. Spring Boot has a robust developer community and strong documentation, which makes it easier for developers to find support and answers to their questions.
