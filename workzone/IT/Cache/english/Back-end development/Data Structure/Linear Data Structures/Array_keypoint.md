1. An array is a collection of data elements that are of the same data type and are accessed by an index or a key value.

2. Arrays are used to store and manipulate large amounts of data and are essential in programming languages.

3. The elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations, and each element has a unique index number.

4. Arrays can be declared in different ways, such as a fixed-length array, a dynamic array or an associative array.

5. Fixed-length arrays are declared with a specific size and cannot be resized during runtime.

6. Dynamic arrays are declared without specific size and can be resized during runtime as needed.

7. Associative arrays are arrays that are indexed by a key value, rather than an integer index.

8. Arrays can be multidimensional, which means they can hold values of the same or different data types in multiple rows and columns.

9. Arrays can be sorted and searched, allowing for efficient data processing.

10. Arrays are used extensively in algorithms, data structures, and programming languages like Java, C, and Python.
