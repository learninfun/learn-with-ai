As an AI language model, let me explain Stack and give an example for you.

A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added to the stack is the first element to be removed. The elements in a stack are added to the top of the stack, and removal also happens from the top of the stack.

For example, consider a stack of books. You can add books to the top of the stack and remove books from the top of the stack. When you add a book, it goes on top of the pile, and when you remove a book, you take it from the top of the pile. This follows the LIFO principle of the stack.

Similarly, in programming, a stack is used to store and retrieve data in a specific way. For instance, when a function is called in a computer program, the computer stores the current instruction pointer and context of execution in a "stack frame." This stack frame is then popped off the stack when the function has completed its execution.
