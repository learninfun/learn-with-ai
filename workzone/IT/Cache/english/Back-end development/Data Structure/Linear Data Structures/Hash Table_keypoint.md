1. Hash tables are a data structure that store data in key-value pairs.
2. They use a hash function to map the key to an index in an array.
3. This allows for fast retrieval of values based on their keys, with an average time complexity of O(1).
4. Collision resolution techniques such as chaining or open addressing must be used to handle situations where multiple keys map to the same index.
5. Hash tables can be used for a variety of applications, such as implementing dictionaries or counting occurrences of elements in a dataset.
6. They are commonly used in programming languages and databases to store and access large datasets efficiently.
