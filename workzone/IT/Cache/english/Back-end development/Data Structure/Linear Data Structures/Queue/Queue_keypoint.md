1. A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
2. It is used to hold elements that need to be processed in the same order as they were added.
3. The two main operations performed on a queue are adding an element to the rear end, and removing an element from the front end.
4. The rear end is where new elements can be added, while the front end is where the next element to be processed is located.
5. Queues can be implemented using an array or a linked list, with the latter being more efficient for large numbers of elements.
6. A queue can be either bounded (finite size) or unbounded (infinite size).
7. Some common applications of queues include job scheduling, printer spooling, and web server request handling.
8. There are several variations of the queue, including circular, priority, and double-ended (deque) queues.
