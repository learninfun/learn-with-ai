A Circular Queue is a type of Queue data structure where the end of the queue and start of the queue are connected. When an element is removed from the queue, the queue is not actually empty but it is considered as empty since the start pointer is equal to the end pointer.

An example of a Circular Queue is a printing queue in a computer system. Suppose there are 10 documents that are to be printed and they are added to a printing queue, with the latest document added at the end. When the first document is printed, the queue moves and the second document is now the first, the third document becomes the second and so on. In a Circular Queue, the printer keeps printing items in a loop, and when it reaches the end of the queue, it continues from the beginning. Thus, the Circular Queue solves the problem of having a full queue and not being able to add any more elements to it.
