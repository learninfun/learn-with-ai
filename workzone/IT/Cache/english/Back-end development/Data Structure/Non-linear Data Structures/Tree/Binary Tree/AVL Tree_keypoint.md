1) An AVL tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree.
2) It maintains a balance factor which determines if a subtree is balanced or not.
3) The balance factor is calculated by subtracting the height of the right subtree from the height of the left subtree.
4) The AVL tree performs rotations (left rotation and right rotation) to balance the tree.
5) A left rotation is performed when the balance factor is greater than 1 on the right of a node.
6) A right rotation is performed when the balance factor is less than -1 on the left of a node.
7) The time complexity of AVL tree operations like insertion, deletion, and search is O(logn) on average and worst case.
