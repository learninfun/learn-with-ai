1) What is a Red-Black Tree?
Answer: A Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree with each node colored either red or black, ensuring that the tree is height-balanced and closely resembles a balanced tree. 

2) What is the maximum height of a Red-Black Tree with N nodes?
Answer: The maximum height of a Red-Black Tree with N nodes is 2*log(N+1). 

3) How are nodes colored in a Red-Black Tree?
Answer: Nodes in a Red-Black Tree are colored either red or black, with the color chosen based on certain conditions: the root is always black, all leaves are black, and if a node is red, then both its children must be black. 

4) What are the operations that can be performed on a Red-Black Tree?
Answer: The operations that can be performed on a Red-Black Tree include insertion, deletion, searching, traversal, and rotation. 

5) How does rotation help balance a Red-Black Tree?
Answer: Rotation helps balance a Red-Black Tree by re-positioning nodes to maintain the red-black property while preventing the height of the tree from exceeding log(N) with N nodes. Rotation can be performed in two ways: left-rotation and right-rotation.
