1. What is an AVL tree and how does it differ from a regular binary search tree?
2. Why is it important for an AVL tree to maintain a balance factor of -1, 0, or 1? 
3. How is the balance factor of an AVL tree calculated and how does it affect tree operations?
4. Can an AVL tree be constructed recursively or iteratively? Which is preferred and why? 
5. How does an AVL tree perform in terms of time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion compared to other tree structures such as a red-black tree or a B-tree?
