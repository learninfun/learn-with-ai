1. B-Tree is a self-balancing data structure that maintains data sorted in a hierarchical manner.

2. It is particularly efficient for disk-based systems, where data is stored in blocks, and retrieval of data from one block is faster than from different blocks.

3. It facilitates searching, insertion, and deletion of data in logarithmic time, i.e., O(log n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements stored in the tree.

4. B-Tree's structure contains a root node, internal nodes, and leaf nodes. The number of nodes between the root and leaf nodes is known as the height of the tree.

5. B-Tree maintains a minimum and maximum number of children, known as the order of the tree. The most commonly used orders are 2-3, 3-4, and 4-5.

6. B-Tree allows more than one key to be stored in a single node, increasing the storage efficiency and reducing the number of disk accesses needed.

7. B-Tree's structure is optimized for disk I/O operations, making it an ideal choice for databases and file systems.

8. B-Tree is resistant to node splits and merges, resulting in a more robust data structure in the long run.

9. B-Tree can handle a high volume of data, making it suitable for large-scale applications.

10. B-Tree is used in many real-world applications, including databases, file systems, and search engines, demonstrating its versatility and usefulness in various fields.
