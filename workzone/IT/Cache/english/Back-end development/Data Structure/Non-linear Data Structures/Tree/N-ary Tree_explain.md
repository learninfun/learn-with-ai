A N-ary tree is a tree structure where each node can have at most n child nodes. In other words, it is a tree where each parent node can have n number of child nodes. This is different from a binary tree, where each node can only have two child nodes.

For example, a ternary tree is a type of N-ary tree where each parent node can have up to 3 child nodes. Here is an example of a ternary tree:

          A
        / | \
       B  C  D
     / | \
    E  F  G

In this example, the root node is A, and it has three child nodes - B, C, and D. Each of these child nodes can have up to three child nodes of their own, resulting in a ternary tree structure. This type of tree can be useful for representing data that has a hierarchical or multi-level structure, such as organizational charts, family trees, or file systems.
