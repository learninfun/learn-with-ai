1) What is a Huffman Tree and what is its purpose in data compression?
- A Huffman Tree is a binary tree data structure used to encode a set of characters based on their frequency in a message. It is used in data compression to reduce the size of messages while maintaining their integrity.

2) How is a Huffman Tree constructed and what is the algorithm used?
- A Huffman Tree is constructed by merging the two lowest frequency characters into a single node, repeating this process until all characters are accounted for. The algorithm used is a greedy algorithm, where nodes with the lowest frequency are always merged first.

3) Can a Huffman Tree be used for decoding as well as encoding?
- Yes, a Huffman Tree can be used for both encoding and decoding. The tree is used to assign binary codes to characters, which can then be used to compress and decompress messages.

4) What is the maximum depth of a Huffman Tree and how does it affect compression efficiency?
- The maximum depth of a Huffman Tree is determined by the frequency of the least frequent character. It affects compression efficiency because deeper trees correspond to longer codes, which may decrease the overall compression rate.

5) How does the use of a Huffman Tree compare to other compression algorithms, such as Run-Length Encoding?
- Huffman encoding is generally more efficient than Run-Length Encoding in scenarios where there is a high level of repetition in data. However, the effectiveness of each algorithm can depend on the specific data set being compressed.
