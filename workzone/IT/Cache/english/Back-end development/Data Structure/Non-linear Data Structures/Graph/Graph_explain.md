A graph, in mathematics, is a set of vertices (also known as nodes) connected by edges. It is often represented visually as a diagram that depicts the relationships between different objects or elements. Graphs can be used to model complex systems, analyze data, and solve problems in a variety of fields, such as computer science, physics, biology, and social sciences.

For example, a social network can be represented as a graph where each person is a vertex and their relationships (e.g. friendships, family ties, work connections) are represented by edges. The graph can be analyzed to identify clusters of people with similar interests or to determine which individuals act as connectors between different groups. Another example of a graph is a flow chart which is often used in computer programming to depict the flow of code execution.
