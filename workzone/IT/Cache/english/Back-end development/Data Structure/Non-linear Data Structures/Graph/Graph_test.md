1. What is the difference between a directed graph and an undirected graph?
Answer: A directed graph has edges that are one-way, while an undirected graph has edges that can be traversed in both directions.

2. What is a cycle in a graph?
Answer: A cycle is a path in a graph that begins and ends at the same vertex, and has no repeated edges or vertices.

3. What is the shortest path algorithm in graph theory?
Answer: Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular shortest path algorithm that computes the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph.

4. What is the degree of a vertex in a graph?
Answer: The degree of a vertex refers to the number of edges that are incident to that vertex. For example, a vertex with three edges connected to it has a degree of three.

5. What is an adjacency matrix in graph theory?
Answer: An adjacency matrix is a square matrix that represents a graph, where the rows and columns correspond to the vertices and the elements of the matrix indicate whether there is an edge between two vertices or not.
