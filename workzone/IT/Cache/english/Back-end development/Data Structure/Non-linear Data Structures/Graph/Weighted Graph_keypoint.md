1. Weighted graph is a graph where each edge (or link) is associated with a numerical value, known as weight or cost.
2. Weighted graph used to represent networks where the edges have different costs, such as road networks with varying distances between nodes or computer networks with different bandwidths.
3. The weight of an edge can represent various things, such as the distance between nodes, the time it takes to travel between nodes, the cost of transmitting data between nodes, etc.
4. The weights on edges can be positive or negative, indicating a gain or loss of some sort.
5. A weighted graph can be represented using an adjacency matrix, where the elements of the matrix represent the weight of the edges between nodes.
6. Weighted graphs are used in several algorithms such as Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm, Prim’s minimum spanning tree algorithm, and the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
7. The edges of a weighted graph may or may not have a direction (undirected or directed graphs).
8. The total weight of a path in a weighted graph is the sum of the weights of the edges on the path. 
9. The goal in many applications involving weighted graphs is to find the shortest or minimum cost path from one node to another.
