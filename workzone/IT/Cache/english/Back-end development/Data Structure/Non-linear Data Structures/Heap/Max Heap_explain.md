Max Heap is a data structure which is a complete binary tree where the value of each node is greater than or equal to its children. In other words, the root node has the maximum value in the heap. For example, let's say we have a max heap of the following values:

          15
        /    \
      10     13
     /  \   /  \
    9   8  11  7
    
In this case, the root node has the maximum value of 15, and the value of any node is greater than or equal to its children. The left child of 15 is 10, which is smaller than 15 but greater than its child nodes. Similarly, the right child of 15 is 13, which is also smaller than 15 but greater than its child nodes. This pattern continues throughout the heap. 

Max Heap is used in many applications, such as priority queues, heapsort, and graph algorithms.
