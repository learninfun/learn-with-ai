A Binary Heap is a type of data structure that is used to store and manage a set of ordered elements. It is called a “heap” because it resembles a pile of items where the most important items are at the top. It is a complete binary tree with a special ordering property whereby the value of each node is never less than the value of its children.

There are two types of Binary Heaps- Min Heap and Max Heap. In Min Heap, the parent node is always smaller than its child nodes while in Max Heap, the parent node is always greater than its child nodes.

Example: Suppose we have an array of numbers {10, 20, 15, 12, 40, 25, 18}. We can build a min-heap by following these steps:

1. Start with the first element (10) and create a node at the root of the heap.
2. Compare the next element (20) with the root. Since 20 is greater than 10, swap these elements.
3. Insert element 15 as the left child of 10.
4. Compare the next element (12) with its parent (20). Since 12 is less than 20, insert it as the left child of 20.
5. Compare the next element (40) with its parent (10). Since 40 is greater than 10 and 20, insert it as the right child of 20.
6. Compare the next element (25) with its parent (12). Since 25 is greater than 12, insert it as the right child of 12.
7. Compare the next element (18) with its parent (15). Since 18 is greater than 15, insert it as the right child of 15.

The resulting binary heap would look like this:

         10
       /     \
     20      15
    /  \     / \
  12   40  25  18

This is an example of a min heap, where the smallest element is at the root of the tree.
