Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which means it uses objects to represent data and functionality. Object-oriented programming is a way of programming that focuses on creating modular, reusable code. This modular code is then combined together to create more complex applications.

In Java, objects are created using classes, which define the properties and methods of the object. A class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects of a certain type. It defines the characteristics and behaviors of objects that belong to that class.

For example, let's say you're developing a bank application. You might create a class called Account, which would define the properties and methods of a bank account, such as the account number, balance, and withdraw method. Here's an example of what the Java code for such a class might look like:

```
public class Account {
    private int accountNumber;
    private double balance;

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {
            balance -= amount;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient funds");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we've defined a class called Account, which has two private instance variables, accountNumber and balance. We've also defined two methods, getBalance and withdraw. The getBalance method returns the balance of the account, while the withdraw method allows the user to withdraw money from the account as long as they have enough funds.

This is just a simple example of how Java's object-oriented programming works, but it gives you an idea of how classes and objects can be used to create modular, reusable code. By breaking down complex applications into smaller, more manageable pieces, developers can create applications that are easier to maintain and extend over time.
