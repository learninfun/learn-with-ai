1. What is Java reflection?
Answer: Java reflection is a mechanism that provides introspection of Java code and allows you to examine or modify the behavior of applications running within the Java Virtual Machine.

2. How does Java reflection work?
Answer: Java reflection works by inspecting Java code at runtime and providing access to its metadata, such as class names, methods, fields, and annotations. This allows you to dynamically create new objects, invoke methods, and access fields.

3. What is the difference between static and dynamic reflection?
Answer: Static reflection is the process of inspecting Java code at compile time, while dynamic reflection is the process of inspecting Java code at runtime. Static reflection is limited to the information available at compile time, while dynamic reflection can access more comprehensive information about the code at runtime.

4. How can you use Java reflection to create a new instance of a class?
Answer: To create a new instance of a class using Java reflection, you can first obtain the class object using Class.forName() or ClassLoader.loadClass(), then call the newInstance() method on the class object.

5. What are some potential security risks associated with Java reflection?
Answer: Java reflection can allow an attacker to access private variables, execute private methods, or instantiate private classes, which can be a security risk if not properly secured. It is important to understand the security implications of using Java reflection and to be aware of best practices for securing your code.
