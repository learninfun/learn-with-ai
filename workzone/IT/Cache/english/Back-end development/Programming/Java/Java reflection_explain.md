Java reflection is a powerful feature that allows Java programs to inspect and modify the behavior of objects at runtime. With reflection, a program can access information about an object's class, methods, fields, and constructors, and even create new instances of classes dynamically.

For example, suppose we have a class called "Person" with private fields "name" and "age":

```
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
}
```

Using reflection, we can create a new instance of this class, set its private fields, and call its methods, like this:

```
Class<Person> personClass = Person.class;
Constructor<Person> constructor = personClass.getConstructor(String.class, int.class);
Person person = constructor.newInstance("Alice", 30);

Field nameField = personClass.getDeclaredField("name");
nameField.setAccessible(true);
nameField.set(person, "Bob");

Method getNameMethod = personClass.getMethod("getName");
System.out.println(getNameMethod.invoke(person)); // Prints "Bob"
```

In this example, we obtain the `Class` object for the `Person` class using the `.class` operator. We then use reflection to obtain the constructor for the `Person` class that takes a `String` and an `int` as arguments. We create a new instance of `Person` using this constructor, passing in the values "Alice" and 30.

Next, we obtain the `Field` object corresponding to the "name" field of the `Person` class using the `getDeclaredField` method. Fields are private by default, so we must call `setAccessible(true)` to allow access to this field. We then use reflection to set the value of this field in our `Person` instance to "Bob".

Finally, we obtain the `Method` object corresponding to the `getName` method of the `Person` class using the `getMethod` method. We call this method on our `Person` instance using reflection, obtaining the value "Bob" as expected.
