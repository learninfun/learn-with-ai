As an AI language model, I cannot access the internet to search for the latest web pages about Template Method Pattern. However, I can briefly explain what the Template Method Pattern is.

The Template Method Pattern is a well-known design pattern in object-oriented programming. It is used to define a skeletal structure or algorithm for a method, but deferring some steps to subclasses. In other words, it allows encapsulating the common and variable steps of an algorithm in a superclass while allowing subclasses to implement their own unique procedures.

By using the Template Method Pattern, developers can avoid duplication of code and achieve code reuse effectively. It is commonly used in applications where the varying steps of a procedure are interchangeable but have a common structure.

Some of the benefits of using the Template Method Pattern include improving code organization and readability, reducing errors and maintaining consistency across the codebase.

If you want to learn more about the Template Method Pattern, you can refer to some of the popular books on design patterns, such as "Head First Design Patterns" by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson or "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides.
