The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines an abstract class containing a template method that defines the steps of an algorithm. The template method calls abstract methods, which are overridden by concrete subclasses to implement the steps of the algorithm.

Example:

A simple example of the Template Method Pattern can be to make tea. The template for making tea includes the following steps:
1. Boil water
2. Steep tea leaves in hot water
3. Add sugar and milk
4. Strain the tea

The abstract class Tea provides the template method makeTea(), which calls the abstract methods boilWater(), steepTeaLeaves(), addSugarAndMilk(), and strainTea(). 

The concrete subclass BlackTea overrides the abstract methods to implement the steps of the algorithm for making black tea, whereas the concrete subclass GreenTea overrides the abstract methods to implement the steps of the algorithm for making green tea.

Thus, the Template Method Pattern allows for the creation of a generic algorithm, while leaving the details of the implementation to the subclasses.
