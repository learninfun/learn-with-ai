1. The Memento Pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows an object's state to be saved and restored.
2. The pattern consists of three components: the Originator, the Memento, and the Caretaker.
3. The Originator is the object whose state is being saved and restored. It creates a Memento that contains a snapshot of its current state.
4. The Memento is an object that stores the state of the Originator at a specific point in time.
5. The Caretaker is responsible for managing a collection of Mementos and facilitating the saving and restoring of the Originator's state. It interacts with the Originator to create and restore Mementos, but it does not modify them.
6. The Memento Pattern can improve the maintainability and flexibility of an application by decoupling the state-saving and state-restoring logic from the Originator.
7. The pattern can be adapted to meet the needs of different use cases, such as undo/redo functionality, transaction management, and caching.
