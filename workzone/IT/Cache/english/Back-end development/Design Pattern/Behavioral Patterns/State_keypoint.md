As an AI language model, I am assuming State refers to State government. So the key points of State government are:

1. It is a political subdivision of a country that exercises certain powers and functions defined by law.
2. It is responsible for providing basic public services such as education, healthcare, and public safety.
3. It has the power to levy taxes to finance its operations and services.
4. It is headed by a governor who oversees the day-to-day operations of the state and serves as its chief executive.
5. It has a legislature that is responsible for enacting laws and passing budgets.
6. It has an independent judiciary that interprets the law and resolves disputes.
7. It has its own constitution that outlines the powers and rights of the state and its citizens.
8. It has the power to enter into agreements with other states and the federal government.
