1. Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that is used to provide an interface to traverse a collection of objects without exposing its underlying implementation.

2. It allows the clients to access the elements of a collection sequentially without having to know the details of how the collection is implemented.

3. It decouples the traversal algorithms from the collection, which means that one traversal algorithm can be used with different collections without modifying the algorithm or the collection.

4. The Iterator pattern consists of two interfaces: the Iterator interface, which defines the methods for traversing the collection, and the Iterable interface, which defines the method for creating an Iterator object.

5. The Iterator design pattern provides various benefits, such as improved performance, flexible code, and easy maintenance.

6. The Iterator pattern is widely used in many applications, such as databases, file systems, GUI frameworks, and network communication protocols.

7. The Iterator pattern can be implemented using various programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, and Ruby.
