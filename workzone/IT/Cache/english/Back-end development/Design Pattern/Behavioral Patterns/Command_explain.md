A command is a specific instruction given to a computer program or operating system using a designated format or language. It is used to tell the computer to perform a specific task, and can take input from the user and provide an output in response to the task.

For example, the command "mkdir" is used to create a new directory within a file system. The syntax for using the mkdir command is "mkdir [directory name]". So, if you wanted to create a directory called "new_directory" you would type "mkdir new_directory" into the command line. The computer would then execute the command and create a new directory with the specified name within the current directory.
