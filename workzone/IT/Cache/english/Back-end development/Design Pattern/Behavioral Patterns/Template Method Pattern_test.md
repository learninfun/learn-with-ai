1. What is the basic idea behind the Template Method Pattern?
Answer: The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, with specific steps implemented in derived classes. This allows the algorithm to be customized while maintaining its structure.

2. How does the Template Method Pattern differ from other design patterns like the Strategy or Observer patterns?
Answer: While the Template Method Pattern provides a framework for implementing algorithms, the Strategy Pattern provides a way to dynamically change the behavior of an object, and the Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects.

3. What are the benefits of using the Template Method Pattern?
Answer: The Template Method Pattern provides a way to encapsulate common algorithms in a base class, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability. It also allows for customization of the algorithm without changing its overall structure.

4. Can the Template Method Pattern be used for complex algorithms?
Answer: Yes, the Template Method Pattern can be used for both simple and complex algorithms. However, care must be taken to ensure that the base class provides enough flexibility to accommodate different variations of the algorithm.

5. How does the Template Method Pattern relate to the Open/Closed Principle?
Answer: The Template Method Pattern is designed to adhere to the Open/Closed Principle, which states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. By defining a base class and allowing derived classes to provide specific implementations, the algorithm can be extended without modifying the original code.
