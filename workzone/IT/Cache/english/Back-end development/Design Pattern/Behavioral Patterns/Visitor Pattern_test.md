1) What is the Visitor Pattern?
Answer: The Visitor Pattern is a design pattern that allows you to separate the algorithms from the objects that they operate on.

2) What problem does the Visitor Pattern solve?
Answer: The Visitor Pattern solves the problem of needing to perform operations on a set of objects without changing the class hierarchy or modifying the objects themselves.

3) How does the Visitor Pattern work?
Answer: The Visitor Pattern works by defining a visitor interface with a method for each class in the object hierarchy that needs to be operated on. The visitor interface is implemented by concrete visitor classes that encapsulate the algorithms that operate on the objects.

4) What are the advantages of using the Visitor Pattern?
Answer: The advantages of using the Visitor Pattern include improved maintainability, increased flexibility, and better separation of concerns.

5) What are some common use cases for the Visitor Pattern?
Answer: Some common use cases for the Visitor Pattern include abstract syntax trees, compilers, and GUI libraries that need to perform operations on a set of objects without modifying their class hierarchy.
