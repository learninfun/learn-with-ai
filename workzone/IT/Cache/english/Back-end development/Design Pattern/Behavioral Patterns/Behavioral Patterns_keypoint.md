- Behavioral patterns are design patterns that focus on improving the communication and interaction between objects in a system.
- The Observer pattern is used when one object requires to be notified about changes to the state of another object.
- The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows a request to pass through a chain of objects until an object handles the request.
- The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing it to be parameterized, queued, and executed at different times.
- The Strategy pattern allows different algorithms or strategies to be selected at runtime, depending on the context.
- The State pattern allows an object to change its behavior when its state changes.
- The Template Method pattern defines the steps of an algorithm in a base class, allowing subclasses to override certain steps without changing the overall algorithm.
- The Visitor pattern allows functionality to be added to an object hierarchy without changing the classes of the objects.
- The Interpreter pattern defines a grammar for a language and uses an interpreter to interpret sentences in the language.
