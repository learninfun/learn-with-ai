1. Bridge pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation, so that they can vary independently.
2. The pattern involves creating abstractions and implementations as separate class hierarchies.
3. The abstractions and implementations are connected using a bridge that allows the two hierarchies to work together.
4. The bridge is implemented as an interface, which is used by the abstraction to access the implementation.
5. The client uses the abstraction, which delegates its requests to the implementation through the bridge.
6. This allows the client to work with different implementations of the abstraction without needing to modify the code.
7. The pattern promotes loose coupling, which makes the code more flexible, maintainable, and testable.
8. The bridge pattern is particularly useful when you have multiple variations of an abstraction or implementation that need to be managed.
