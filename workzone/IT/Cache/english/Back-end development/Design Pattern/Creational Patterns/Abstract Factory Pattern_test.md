1. What is the purpose of the Abstract Factory Pattern?

Answer: The purpose of the Abstract Factory Pattern is to provide an interface that allows the creation of a set of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

2. What is the difference between the Abstract Factory Pattern and the Factory Method Pattern?

Answer: The Factory Method Pattern uses a single method to create objects, while the Abstract Factory Pattern uses a family of related methods to create sets of related objects.

3. How does the Abstract Factory Pattern promote maintainability and extensibility?

Answer: By using an abstract interface to create related sets of objects, the Abstract Factory Pattern allows for easy replacement or extension of the underlying concrete classes without affecting the client code.

4. When should the Abstract Factory Pattern be used?

Answer: The Abstract Factory Pattern should be used when the client needs to create sets of related objects, and when the concrete classes used to create those objects may need to be replaced or extended in the future.

5. What are the potential drawbacks of using the Abstract Factory Pattern?

Answer: One potential drawback of using the Abstract Factory Pattern is that it can introduce additional complexity into the code, especially if the number of concrete classes and interfaces required increases. Additionally, it may not always be clear how to divide related objects into separate families.
