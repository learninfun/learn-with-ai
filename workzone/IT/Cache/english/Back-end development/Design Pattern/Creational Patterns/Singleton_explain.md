Singleton is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance and ensures that this instance has a global access point.

Here is an example:

Suppose you are building a class `Printer` to print documents. It is important that only one instance of the Printer class can exist, otherwise there would be conflicts in print jobs, and it could cause delays or other issues. So, you could implement the Singleton pattern in the Printer class, as follows:

```python
class Printer:
    __instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls.__instance is None:
            cls.__instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls.__instance

    def print_document(self, document):
        # code to print the document
```

In this example, we use the `__new__` method to ensure that only one instance of Printer class can be created. Once an instance has been created, the subsequent calls to create an object of the Printer class will reuse the existing instance.

To create an object of the Printer class, we can simply call its constructor as follows:

```python
printer = Printer()
```

The `printer` object here will always reference the same instance of the Printer class, because the Singleton pattern ensures that there can only be one instance of this class.
