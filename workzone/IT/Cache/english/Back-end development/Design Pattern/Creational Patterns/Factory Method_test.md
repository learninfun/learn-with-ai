1. Q: What is the purpose of the Factory Method pattern?
A: The Factory Method pattern is used to create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client and allowing subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.

2. Q: How does the Factory Method pattern differ from simply instantiating objects using the new keyword?
A: With the Factory Method pattern, the creation logic is encapsulated in a separate method or class, allowing for greater flexibility and maintaining loose coupling between objects.

3. Q: Can the Factory Method pattern be used in conjunction with other design patterns?
A: Yes, the Factory Method pattern is often used in conjunction with other patterns such as the Abstract Factory pattern, Singleton pattern, and Prototype pattern.

4. Q: What are some common variations of the Factory Method pattern?
A: Some variations of the Factory Method pattern include the Static Factory Method, which uses a static method to create objects, and the Abstract Factory pattern, which creates families of related objects.

5. Q: What are some potential drawbacks of using the Factory Method pattern?
A: One potential drawback is that adding new products to the factory may require changes to the factory interface or implementation, which can be time-consuming and potentially disruptive. Additionally, if the factory implementation is complex or poorly designed, it can be difficult to maintain and debug.
