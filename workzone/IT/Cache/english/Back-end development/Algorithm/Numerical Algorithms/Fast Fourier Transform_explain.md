Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an algorithm that is used to analyze a time-domain signal and represents it in the frequency-domain. This mathematical technique is a fast and efficient way of computing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and is widely used in many areas of science, such as signal processing, audio engineering, and image analysis.

The FFT algorithm works by breaking down a signal into smaller segments, each of which can be processed independently, and then combining the results to obtain the final frequency representation. This process reduces the number of computations required to compute the DFT from N2 to N log2 N, which makes it much faster than the standard DFT algorithm.

An example of an application of the FFT algorithm is in audio engineering, where it is used to convert a digital audio signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. This allows audio engineers to identify and remove unwanted harmonic distortion, equalize audio levels, or isolate specific audio frequencies, among other things. For instance, an audio engineer might use the FFT algorithm to analyze a bass-heavy track and identify the specific frequencies that are causing the mix to sound muddy or distorted. They can then use this information to modify the audio mix to improve its overall clarity and balance.
