1. The Miller-Rabin Algorithm is used to test whether a given number is a prime number or not.
2. It is a probabilistic algorithm, which means that it has a small chance of making an error when identifying a number as a prime (known as a false positive).
3. The algorithm uses the concept of strong pseudoprimes and witnesses to identify whether a number is a prime or not.
4. A strong pseudoprime is a number that passes several tests for prime numbers but is, in fact, composite (not prime).
5. A witness is a number that can be used to prove that a number is composite (not prime).
6. The algorithm works by selecting a random witness and using it to test the number in question. If the number is composite, the witness will identify it as such with a high probability.
7. If the number passes several tests with different random witnesses, it is highly likely to be a prime number.
8. The Miller-Rabin Algorithm is faster than many other primality tests, making it useful for large numbers as well.
