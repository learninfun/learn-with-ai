Euclid's Algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers using division and subtraction. It is named after the Greek mathematician Euclid, who described the algorithm in his book "Elements" around 300 BC.

Here's how Euclid's Algorithm works:

1. Take the two numbers you want to find the GCF for.
2. Divide the larger number by the smaller number.
3. Take the remainder and divide the smaller number by it.
4. Repeat step 3 until the remainder is zero.
5. The last divisor (which was the remainder that equaled zero) is the GCF of the original two numbers.

For example, let's find the GCF of 18 and 12 using Euclid's Algorithm:

Step 1: Take 18 and 12.
Step 2: Divide 18 by 12 to get 1 with a remainder of 6 (18 รท 12 = 1 remainder 6).
Step 3: Divide 12 by 6 to get 2 with a remainder of 0 (12 รท 6 = 2 remainder 0).
Step 4: The algorithm ends, and the last divisor used was 6.
Step 5: Therefore, 6 is the GCF of 18 and 12.
