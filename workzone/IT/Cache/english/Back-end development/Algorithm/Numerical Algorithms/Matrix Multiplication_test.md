1. What is the difference between element-wise multiplication and matrix multiplication?
Answer: Element-wise multiplication multiplies corresponding elements of two matrices, resulting in a matrix with the same dimensions as the original matrices. Matrix multiplication multiplies entire rows and columns and calculates the sum of these products.

2. Can you multiply two matrices with different dimensions?
Answer: No, you cannot multiply two matrices that do not have compatible dimensions. The number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.

3. What is the identity matrix, and how is it used in matrix multiplication?
Answer: The identity matrix is a square matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros everywhere else. When multiplied by any matrix, the identity matrix preserves the original matrix's dimensions and properties.

4. How do you calculate the transpose of a matrix, and how is it used in matrix multiplication?
Answer: The transpose of a matrix involves exchanging its rows and columns. This is denoted by the superscript T. When multiplying two matrices, one must be transposed to ensure the matrices have compatible dimensions.

5. How many scalar multiplications are required to multiply two n x n matrices?
Answer: The standard algorithm for matrix multiplication requires n^3 scalar multiplications in total. This is because each element in the resulting matrix is the sum of n products of corresponding elements from the two input matrices.
