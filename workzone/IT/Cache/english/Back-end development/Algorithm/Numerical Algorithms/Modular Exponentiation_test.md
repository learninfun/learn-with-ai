1. What is modular exponentiation?
Answer: Modular exponentiation is the operation of raising a number to a power and then taking the remainder when dividing by a modulus.

2. How can modular exponentiation be calculated efficiently?
Answer: Modular exponentiation can be calculated efficiently using the repeated squaring algorithm, also known as the binary exponentiation algorithm.

3. What is the running time of the repeated squaring algorithm for modular exponentiation?
Answer: The running time of the repeated squaring algorithm for modular exponentiation is O(log n), where n is the exponent.

4. How can modular exponentiation be used in cryptography?
Answer: Modular exponentiation is used in cryptography for the implementation of key exchange protocols, digital signature schemes, and encryption algorithms such as RSA.

5. What is the inverse of modular exponentiation?
Answer: The inverse of modular exponentiation is modular logarithm, which is the operation of finding the exponent when given the base, modulus, and result of the modular exponentiation.
