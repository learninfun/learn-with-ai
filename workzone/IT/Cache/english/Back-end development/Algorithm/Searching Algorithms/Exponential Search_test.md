1. What is the time complexity of Exponential Search? 
Answer: The time complexity of Exponential Search is O(log n).

2. How does Exponential Search differ from Binary Search in terms of its approach? 
Answer: Exponential Search uses a logarithmic approach where the search space is doubled each time, while Binary Search divides the search space in half.

3. What is the advantage of using Exponential Search over Binary Search? 
Answer: Exponential Search can be more efficient than Binary Search in scenarios where the size of the search space is unknown or unbounded.

4. Can Exponential Search be used to search for a value in an unordered list? 
Answer: No, Exponential Search requires the list to be sorted in ascending or descending order.

5. What happens if the target value is not found in the list during an Exponential Search? 
Answer: The algorithm will continue to double the range until it exceeds the length of the list, causing the search to fail and return a -1 value.
