1) What is the time complexity of linear search algorithm? 
Answer: O(n)

2) Which algorithm is more efficient in searching a sorted array, binary search or linear search? 
Answer: Binary search

3) What is the worst case time complexity of binary search algorithm? 
Answer: O(log n)

4) In which scenario is linear search preferred over binary search? 
Answer: When the data is not sorted

5) What is a hash table and how is it used in searching algorithms? 
Answer: A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. It is used in search algorithms to achieve constant time lookup of values.
