Space complexity analysis refers to the measure of the amount of memory or storage required by an algorithm to solve a problem. It quantifies the amount of space an algorithm requires relative to the size of its input data. It is concerned with identifying the storage requirements (in terms of memory or disk space) consumed by an algorithm in performing a given task.

Space complexity is typically represented using Big-O notation â€“ a mathematical notation that describes the rate at which memory usage grows concerning input size. The notation O(f(n)) denotes an algorithm that requires a maximum of f(n) space to operate on an input of size n.

For example, consider an algorithm that finds the maximum value in an array of n elements. One approach to solving this problem is to scan the entire array and store the maximum value found so far in a variable. The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1), which is the space required to store the maximum value variable.

As another example, consider an algorithm that sorts an array of n elements using the bubble sort algorithm. This algorithm runs in O(n) space complexity, which means it requires memory proportional to the size of the input data to sort the array. In other words, as the number of elements in the array grows, the memory used by the algorithm grows proportionally.
