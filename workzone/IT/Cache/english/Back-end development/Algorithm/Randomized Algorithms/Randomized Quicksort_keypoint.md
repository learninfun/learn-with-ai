1. Randomized Quicksort is an efficient sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer strategy.
2. It selects a pivot element randomly and partitions the array into two sub-arrays.
3. One sub-array contains elements that are less than or equal to the pivot, while the other sub-array contains elements greater than the pivot.
4. The algorithm recursively sorts the sub-arrays using the same process.
5. The randomized selection of the pivot element ensures that the probability of worst-case performance is reduced.
6. The time complexity of Randomized Quicksort is O(n log n) on average, and O(n^2) in the worst case.
7. Randomized Quicksort is widely used in practice due to its average-case performance and easy implementation.
8. It is also a popular choice for sorting large data sets or in applications where sorting needs to be done quickly.
