1. Randomized Selection is a technique for finding the ith smallest element in an unsorted array. 

2. It works by randomly selecting a pivot element from the array, partitioning the array into elements that are less than or equal to the pivot and elements that are greater than the pivot, and recursively repeating the process on the appropriate subarray until the ith smallest element is found. 

3. The expected running time of Randomized Selection is O(n), where n is the size of the input array. 

4. Randomized Selection is a randomized algorithm, meaning that its performance may vary based on the selection of the initial pivot element. However, the expected running time is always O(n). 

5. If the same ith smallest element needs to be found multiple times, Randomized Selection can be more efficient than sorting the entire array and selecting the ith element. 

6. Randomized Selection can be implemented in different ways, such as by using the Quicksort algorithm or the Partition algorithm. 

7. Randomized Selection is sometimes referred to as the "QuickSelect" algorithm, as it is closely related to Quicksort.
