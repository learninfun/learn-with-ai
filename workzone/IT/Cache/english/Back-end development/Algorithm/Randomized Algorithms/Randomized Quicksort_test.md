1. What is the time complexity of Randomized Quicksort in the worst case?
Answer: The time complexity of Randomized Quicksort in the worst case is O(n^2), where n is the size of the input array.

2. How does Randomized Quicksort differ from regular Quicksort?
Answer: Randomized Quicksort differs from regular Quicksort in that it randomly selects a pivot element, rather than always choosing the first or last element in the array.

3. Is Randomized Quicksort a stable sorting algorithm?
Answer: No, Randomized Quicksort is not a stable sorting algorithm. This means that the relative order of elements with equal values may change during the sorting process.

4. What is the average case time complexity of Randomized Quicksort?
Answer: The average case time complexity of Randomized Quicksort is O(n log n), where n is the size of the input array.

5. How can you implement Randomized Quicksort to efficiently handle duplicate elements in the input array?
Answer: One way to implement Randomized Quicksort to handle duplicate elements is to partition the array into three parts: elements smaller than the pivot, elements equal to the pivot, and elements greater than the pivot. This can be done recursively on the smaller and greater partitions, while leaving the "equal" partition unchanged.
