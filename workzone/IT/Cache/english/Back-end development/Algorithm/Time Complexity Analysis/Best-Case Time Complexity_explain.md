Best-case time complexity is the lowest possible time required by an algorithm to solve a given problem, assuming the optimal input is provided. This scenario is usually rare and should not be used as the only basis for evaluating the performance of an algorithm since it represents very few cases in reality. 

For instance, consider the problem of searching for an element in a sorted array using Binary Search. In the best-case scenario, we get the required element at the middle point of the array, which means that the algorithm would only need one comparison to find it. In this case, the best-case time complexity would be O(1). However, in the worst-case scenario, the element is not found, and the algorithm keeps dividing the array into halves until it reaches the base condition; in this case, the time complexity would be O(log n). 

Therefore, best-case time complexity can be misleading in evaluating an algorithm's efficiency since it does not always represent the real scenario. As such, it is crucial to consider both the best-case and worst-case time complexity when analyzing an algorithm's performance.
