1. What is the definition of Theta Notation?
Answer: Theta Notation represents the upper and lower bounds of a function in terms of the input size by ignoring constant factors and lower-order terms.

2. What is the time complexity of an algorithm that has a running time of Theta(N^2)?
Answer: The time complexity of the algorithm is O(N^2) and Omega(N^2).

3. What is the significance of Theta Notation?
Answer: Theta Notation is used to analyze the growth rate of functions and to compare the efficiency of different algorithms.

4. What is the difference between Theta Notation and Big O Notation?
Answer: Theta Notation gives the tightest possible bound of a function, whereas Big O Notation provides an upper bound of a function.

5. What is the running time of an algorithm that has a time complexity of Theta(1)?
Answer: The running time of the algorithm is constant and does not depend on the input size.
