1. What is the Big O notation for bubble sort algorithm? 
Answer: The Big O notation for bubble sort is O(n^2).

2. What is the worst-case runtime of the binary search algorithm?
Answer: The worst-case runtime of binary search is O(log n).

3. What is the difference between O(1) and O(n) in terms of algorithm efficiency?
Answer: O(1) means that the algorithm takes constant time to run, whereas O(n) means that the runtime of the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input.

4. What is the Big O notation for a nested loop with n iterations in the outer loop and m iterations in the inner loop?
Answer: The Big O notation for a nested loop with n iterations in the outer loop and m iterations in the inner loop is O(n*m).

5. What is the Big O notation for the merge sort algorithm?
Answer: The Big O notation for the merge sort algorithm is O(n*log n).
