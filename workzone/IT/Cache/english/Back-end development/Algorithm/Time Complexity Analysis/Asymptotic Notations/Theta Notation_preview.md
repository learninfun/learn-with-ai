1. What is Theta notation and how is it used in big-O analysis?
2. How does Theta notation differ from other asymptotic notations like big-O and Omega notations?
3. Can you give an example of an algorithm with a theta notation of O(n^2)?
4. Can we say that the theta notation of an algorithm indicates the worst-case time complexity?
5. How can we determine the theta notation of an algorithm with multiple steps?
