1. What is the time complexity of a linear search algorithm?
Answer: The time complexity of a linear search algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

2. What is the time complexity of a binary search algorithm?
Answer: The time complexity of a binary search algorithm is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

3. What is the time complexity of a bubble sort algorithm?
Answer: The time complexity of a bubble sort algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array.

4. What is the time complexity of a merge sort algorithm?
Answer: The time complexity of a merge sort algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

5. What is the time complexity of a factorial algorithm?
Answer: The time complexity of a factorial algorithm is O(n), where n is the number for which the factorial is being calculated.
