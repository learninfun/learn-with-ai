1. What is Greedy Algorithm?
Answer: Greedy Algorithm refers to an algorithm that always chooses the best possible solution at each step, without considering the consequences of the chosen decision.

2. What is the Greedy Method?
Answer: The Greedy Method is a problem-solving strategy that involves making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding the global optimum.

3. What are the pros and cons of Greedy Algorithms?
Answer: The pros of Greedy Algorithms are that they are simple to implement, fast, and usually produce good solutions in practice. The cons are that they may not always find the optimal solution, and they can be difficult to analyze and prove correctness.

4. What is the Knapsack Problem, and how can Greedy Algorithms be used to solve it?
Answer: The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem where you must fill a knapsack with a finite capacity with a selection of items worth a certain value. Greedy Algorithms can be used to solve the problem in some cases, by sorting the items by their value-to-weight ratio and adding the items to the knapsack in descending order until it's full.

5. How can Greedy Algorithms be applied to scheduling problems?
Answer: In scheduling problems, Greedy Algorithms can be used to choose the order in which tasks should be completed. For example, in the Interval Scheduling Problem, the Greedy Algorithm would sort the intervals by their end times and select the one with the earliest end time that doesn't overlap with the previous interval.
