Divide and Conquer is a problem-solving strategy that involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. Each sub-problem is then solved separately, and the solutions are combined to form a solution for the original problem.

An example of Divide and Conquer strategy is the Merge Sort algorithm, used for sorting large sets of data. The algorithm divides the input data into smaller sub-arrays until each sub-array contains only one element. Then, it combines the sub-arrays by merging them in sorted order until a single sorted array is obtained. By using Divide and Conquer, the sorting algorithm is able to handle large datasets efficiently by breaking them into smaller pieces.
