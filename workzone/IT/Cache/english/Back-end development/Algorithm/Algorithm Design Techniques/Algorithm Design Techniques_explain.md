Algorithm design techniques are methods or approaches used to design algorithms that solve a specific problem efficiently. Here are some algorithm design techniques:

1. Divide and conquer: This technique breaks down a problem into smaller subproblems and solves each subproblem recursively. The solution to the original problem is then obtained by combining the solutions to the subproblems. Example: MergeSort algorithm which sorts an array by breaking it down into smaller subarrays and merging the sorted subarrays.

2. Brute force: This technique involves trying every possible solution to a problem until a satisfactory result is obtained. It is often used when the problem size is small or when the time complexity is not a major consideration. Example: Sequential search algorithm used to find an element in an unsorted array.

3. Greedy algorithm: This technique involves making locally optimal choices at each step in the hope of finding a global optimum. It is often used when a problem can be broken down into a set of small decisions that must be made in an optimal manner. Example: Primâ€™s algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.

4. Dynamic programming: This technique breaks down a problem into smaller subproblems and solves each subproblem only once, storing the solution in a table for future reference. The solution to the original problem is obtained by combining the solutions to the subproblems in a specific way. Example: Longest common subsequence algorithm used to find the longest subsequence that is present in two given strings.

5. Backtracking: This technique involves systematically trying different solutions to a problem until a satisfactory result is obtained. It is often used when the problem has multiple possible solutions and the optimal solution is not immediately apparent. Example: Sudoku solver algorithm that tries multiple possible values for each cell until a valid solution is obtained.

Each of these techniques has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of technique depends on the problem being solved, the available resources, and the desired trade-offs between time and space complexity.
