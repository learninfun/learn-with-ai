Shortest path is a problem in graph theory that deals with determining the path with the lowest cost or length between two points in a graph. In other words, it is finding the path with the minimum sum of edge weights.

For example, suppose you have a map of a city with various streets connecting different locations, and you want to find the shortest path from your house to your workplace. The city map can be represented as a graph, where each location is a node and each street connecting two locations is an edge. The edges may have a weight that represents the distance in miles, time taken, or the cost of taking that street. To find the shortest path, we need to determine the path with the minimum sum of edge weights from the starting node (your house) to the ending node (your workplace). 

There are different algorithms to solve the shortest path problem, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm, and Floyd-Warshall algorithm. These algorithms use different strategies to find the shortest path from one node to another in an efficient way.
