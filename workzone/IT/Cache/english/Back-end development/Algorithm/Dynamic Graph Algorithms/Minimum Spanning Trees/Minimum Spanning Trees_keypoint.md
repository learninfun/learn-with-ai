1. A minimum spanning tree is a tree that spans all the nodes of a weighted graph, with the minimum possible total edge weight.
2. There are various algorithms to find the minimum spanning tree, including Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, and Boruvka's algorithm.
3. The minimum spanning tree has applications in various fields such as network design, transportation planning, and clustering problems.
4. In a minimum spanning tree, there is only one unique path between any two nodes.
5. The minimum spanning tree is a subgraph of the original graph, where the number of edges is one less than the number of nodes.
6. The minimum spanning tree is a connected graph, where all nodes are reachable from any other node of the tree.
7. The cost of minimum spanning tree is the sum of the weights of all edges in the tree.
8. If the graph is not connected, it is impossible to create a minimum spanning tree.
9. In a weighted graph with negative edge weights, the minimum spanning tree may not be unique.
10. The minimum spanning tree is a special case of a minimum spanning forest, where multiple trees can be created to span all nodes of the graph.
