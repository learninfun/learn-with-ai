1. What is dynamic MST?

Answer: Dynamic MST is a graph algorithm that updates the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a given graph dynamically, in response to changes in the graph structure or weight. 

2. What is the primary goal of a dynamic MST algorithm?

Answer: The primary goal of a dynamic MST algorithm is to maintain the MST of a graph in real-time, with a minimal number of updates and without computing the MST from scratch every time. 

3. What are the basic operations involved in a dynamic MST algorithm?

Answer: The basic operations involved in a dynamic MST algorithm are adding or removing edges, querying for the current MST and updating the MST after an edge modification. 

4. How does a dynamic MST algorithm differ from a static MST algorithm?

Answer: A dynamic MST algorithm differs from a static MST algorithm in that it is designed to handle changes to the graph dynamically, without recomputing the MST from scratch every time. 

5. What are some common applications of dynamic MST algorithms?

Answer: Some common applications of dynamic MST algorithms include network routing, network maintenance, and resource allocation in distributed systems that involve changing network topologies.
