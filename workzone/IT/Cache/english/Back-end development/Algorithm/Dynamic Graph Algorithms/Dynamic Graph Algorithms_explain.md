Dynamic graph algorithms are algorithms that work on graphs that are changing over time. These algorithms have to take into account how the graph is changing and update their results accordingly. They are useful in situations where the graph is constantly being updated, such as in social networks or network routing.

One example of a dynamic graph algorithm is the Shortest Path Tree (SPT) algorithm. It is used to find the shortest path between two points in a changing graph. The algorithm builds a tree that represents the shortest path from the start node to all other nodes in the graph. As the graph changes, the algorithm updates the tree by adding new nodes and edges and removing old ones.

For instance, consider a scenario where a delivery company is constantly updating their route based on traffic, time of day, and other factors. The SPT algorithm can be used to constantly calculate the shortest routes between each delivery location, and update the route accordingly. This allows the delivery company to optimize their routes in real-time and save time and money.
