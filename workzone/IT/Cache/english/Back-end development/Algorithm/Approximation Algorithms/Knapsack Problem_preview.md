1. What is the Knapsack Problem, and what are its different variations?
2. How is the Knapsack Problem represented, and what are the different methods used to solve it?
3. What are the limitations of brute-force methods in solving Knapsack Problems, and how do heuristics and approximations help in finding better solutions?
4. How does the complexity of the Knapsack Problem change when the number of items or constraints increase, and what are the implications of this on its tractability?
5. What are some of the real-world applications of the Knapsack Problem, and how has it been used in optimizing resource allocation, finance, logistics, and other domains?
