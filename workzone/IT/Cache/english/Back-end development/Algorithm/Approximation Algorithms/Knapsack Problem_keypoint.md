1. Knapsack problem is a type of optimization problem in mathematics and computer science.
2. It involves selecting a set of items with particular values and weights that can be fitted into a knapsack with a limited capacity.
3. The goal is to maximize the value of the items carried in the knapsack while not exceeding the weight capacity.
4. There are two types of knapsack problems: 0/1 knapsack problem and fractional knapsack problem.
5. In the 0/1 knapsack problem, the items can either be chosen or rejected, while in the fractional knapsack problem, the items can be divided into fractions to achieve optimal solutions.
6. Knapsack problem is considered a difficult problem to solve because the number of possible combinations increases exponentially with the number of items to be fitted into the knapsack.
7. Different algorithms have been developed to solve knapsack problem, such as dynamic programming, branch and bound, and genetic algorithms.
8. The applications of knapsack problem include resource allocation, financial portfolio optimization, and data compression.
