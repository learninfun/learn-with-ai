- The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem in which a salesperson must visit a set of cities and return to the starting city, while traveling the shortest possible distance.
- TSP is a NP-hard problem, meaning it is mathematically difficult to solve for large sets of cities.
- TSP has many applications in logistics, transportation planning, and resource allocation.
- Various algorithms have been developed to solve TSP, including brute-force approaches, heuristic algorithms, and approximation algorithms.
- The optimal solution of TSP can only be obtained through exhaustive search if the size of the set of cities is relatively small, but heuristic and approximation algorithms can provide good solutions for larger sets of cities.
- TSP can be formulated as an optimization problem using linear programming or dynamic programming techniques.
- Genetic algorithms and simulated annealing are two popular heuristic algorithms used to solve TSP.
- Traveling Salesman Problem is useful in many areas, such as in the case of food delivery, tour planning, and network optimization.
