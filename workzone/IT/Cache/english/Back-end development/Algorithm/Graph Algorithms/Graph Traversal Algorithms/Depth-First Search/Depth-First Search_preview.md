1. What is the purpose of the Depth-First Search algorithm, and what problems does it typically solve?
2. Can Depth-First Search be used to solve problems that involve graphs or trees with cycles? Why or why not?
3. How does Depth-First Search determine which nodes to visit next, and how does it keep track of nodes that have been visited?
4. What is the running time complexity of Depth-First Search, and how does it compare to other search algorithms such as Breadth-First Search?
5. Can Depth-First Search be modified to search for more than just the presence of a goal node, such as finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph? If so, how?
