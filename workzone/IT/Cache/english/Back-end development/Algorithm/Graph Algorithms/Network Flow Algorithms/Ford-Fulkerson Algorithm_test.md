1. What is the goal of the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm?
Answer: The goal of the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm is to find the maximum flow in a network.

2. What is the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm based on?
Answer: The Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm is based on the concept of augmenting paths.

3. Does the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm always find the maximum flow in a network?
Answer: The Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm may not always find the maximum flow in a network. It depends on the choice of the initial flow network and the order in which the augmenting paths are chosen.

4. How does the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm handle negative weights in a network?
Answer: The Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm cannot handle negative weights in a network. In such a case, other algorithms such as the Bellman-Ford Algorithm need to be used to find the maximum flow.

5. Is the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm guaranteed to terminate when applied to a finite network?
Answer: Yes, the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm is guaranteed to terminate when applied to a finite network, as long as there are no negative weight cycles.
