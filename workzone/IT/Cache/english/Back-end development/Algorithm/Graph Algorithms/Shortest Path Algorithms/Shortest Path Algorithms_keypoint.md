1. Shortest Path algorithms are used to find the shortest path between two points in a graph.
2. These algorithms rely on graph representation, which may be either weighted or unweighted.
3. The most commonly used shortest path algorithms are Dijkstra's Algorithm and Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
4. Dijkstra's algorithm is used for weighted graphs with non-negative edge weights, while the Bellman-Ford algorithm is used for graphs with negative edge weights.
5. Both algorithms work by iteratively updating the distance from the starting node to each of the other nodes in the graph.
6. Dijkstra's algorithm uses a priority queue to efficiently select the next node to visit, while the Bellman-Ford algorithm uses dynamic programming to achieve a similar result.
7. Shortest path algorithms can be used to solve many problems, including routing in computer networks, navigation systems, and finding the optimal path in transportation networks.
