1. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is used to find the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.
2. It works by using dynamic programming, building a matrix of distances between all pairs of vertices.
3. The algorithm assumes that the graph does not contain negative-weight cycles.
4. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^3), where n is the number of vertices in the graph.
5. The algorithm can be used to determine whether or not a graph is strongly connected.
6. The algorithm can also be used to find the diameter of a graph, which is the maximum distance between any two vertices.
7. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is commonly used in computer networking to find the shortest path between two hosts.
