1. Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem.

2. It is used to find the shortest path between a starting node and all other nodes in the graph.

3. The algorithm maintains a set of visited nodes and a set of unvisited nodes.

4. Initially, the distance of the starting node is set to zero, and the distances of all other nodes are set to infinity.

5. The algorithm then explores the neighboring nodes of the starting node, updating their distances if a shorter path is found.

6. The algorithm then selects the unvisited node with the shortest distance and repeats the process.

7. The algorithm terminates when all nodes have been visited or when the destination node is reached.

8. The algorithm also maintains a predecessor array that stores the previous node in the shortest path from the starting node.

9. Once the algorithm is complete, the shortest path can be traced back from the destination node by following the predecessor array.

10. Dijkstra's algorithm works on non-negative weighted graphs and has a time complexity of O(|E|+|V|log|V|) using a min-heap to keep track of the minimum distance.
