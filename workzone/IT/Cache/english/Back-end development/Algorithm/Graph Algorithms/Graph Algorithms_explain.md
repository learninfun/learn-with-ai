Graph algorithms are a set of techniques used to analyze and manipulate graph structures. These algorithms are used to solve various graph problems in computer science and mathematics.

One popular example of a graph algorithm is Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. It is used to find the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph. The algorithm works by assigning a tentative distance to each node, then updating these distances as it examines each neighboring node. The process continues until the shortest path is found.

For example, suppose we have a graph representing a road network between cities. Each edge in the graph has a weight representing the distance between the cities. If we want to find the shortest route from city A to city B, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path. The algorithm will examine each neighboring city, updating the tentative distance to each node until it finds the shortest path. Once the shortest path is found, the algorithm can return the path and its total distance.
