1. What is the worst-case time complexity of Heap Sort?
Answer: The worst-case time complexity of Heap Sort is O(n log n).

2. What is the basic idea behind Heap Sort?
Answer: The basic idea behind Heap Sort is to turn the input array into a binary heap and then repeatedly extract the maximum element from the heap until the array is sorted.

3. Can Heap Sort be used to sort an array in descending order?
Answer: Yes, Heap Sort can be used to sort an array in descending order by simply reversing the comparison function used to define the heap.

4. What is the space complexity of Heap Sort?
Answer: The space complexity of Heap Sort is O(1) since it sorts the input array in-place without requiring any extra memory.

5. Is Heap Sort a stable sorting algorithm?
Answer: No, Heap Sort is not a stable sorting algorithm since it does not preserve the relative order of equal elements in the input array.
