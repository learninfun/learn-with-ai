1. One of the simplest sorting algorithms.
2. Elements are compared pairwise and swapped if necessary until the entire list is sorted.
3. Time complexity is O(n^2), therefore not ideal for large datasets.
4. Efficiency can be improved by adding a flag to prematurely stop sorting when no swaps are needed.
5. Stable sort, meaning that equal elements maintain their relative order.
6. In-place algorithm, meaning that it sorts the list in its original memory space rather than creating a new one.
