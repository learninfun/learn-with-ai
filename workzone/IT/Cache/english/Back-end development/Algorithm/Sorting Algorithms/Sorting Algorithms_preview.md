1. What are the different types of sorting algorithms and how do they differ?
2. How do you measure the efficiency of a sorting algorithm?
3. Can a sorting algorithm ever have a worst-case scenario where it takes longer to sort an array than other algorithms?
4. How do you choose which sorting algorithm to use for a given task?
5. Are there any limitations to sorting algorithms that prevent them from being used in certain scenarios or datasets?
