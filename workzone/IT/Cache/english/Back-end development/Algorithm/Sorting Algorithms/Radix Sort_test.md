1. What is Radix Sort and how does it differ from other sorting algorithms?
Answer: Radix Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts data by processing individual digits or characters. It differs from other sorting algorithms because it sorts data based on the value of the individual digits rather than the value of the entire element.

2. What is the time complexity of Radix Sort and how does it compare to other sorting algorithms?
Answer: The time complexity of Radix Sort is O(w * n), where w is the number of digits or characters in the largest element and n is the number of elements. It is considered to be faster than other comparison-based sorting algorithms such as quicksort, mergesort, and heapsort, especially when the number of elements to be sorted is very large.

3. What is the space complexity of Radix Sort and how can it be improved?
Answer: The space complexity of Radix Sort is O(n + k), where k is the size of the radix or the number of distinct digits or characters. However, this can be improved by using an in-place radix sort where the input array is replaced by a partially sorted array.

4. What is the stability of Radix Sort and why is it important?
Answer: Radix Sort is a stable sorting algorithm which means that it maintains the relative order of equal elements. This is important when there are multiple elements with the same value such as when sorting by last name and age where there may be multiple people with the same last name.

5. What are the limitations of Radix Sort and when should it be used?
Answer: Radix Sort can only be used to sort elements that have a finite number of digits or characters such as integers, strings, and characters. It is not suitable for sorting floating-point numbers or data with variable-length elements. Additionally, it may not be the best choice when the size of the input data is small or when the input data is randomly distributed.
