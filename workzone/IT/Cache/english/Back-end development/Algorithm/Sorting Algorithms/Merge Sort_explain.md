Merge Sort is a popular sorting algorithm that uses a divide and conquer approach to sort an array of elements. The basic idea is to divide the elements into smaller sub-arrays, sort them separately, and then merge them back together in sorted order.

Here's an example of how Merge Sort works:

Suppose we have an array of integers: {5, 2, 9, 14, 1, 8}

1. Divide the array into equal halves:
{5, 2, 9} {14, 1, 8}

2. Divide each subarray into smaller subarrays:
{5} {2, 9}
{14} {1, 8}

3. Divide each subarray into the smallest subarrays:
{5}
{2} {9}
{14}
{1} {8}

4. Two-element subarrays are compared and merged:
{2, 5} {9}
{1, 14} {8}

5. Four-element subarrays are compared and merged:
{2, 5, 9} {1, 8, 14}

6. The final sorted array is obtained:
{1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 14}

The time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n log n), which means it has a relatively fast performance for large datasets. Additionally, it is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that equal elements maintain their relative position in the sorted array.
