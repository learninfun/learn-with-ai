- Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm.
- It works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the list and moving it to the beginning of the sorted part.
- It has a time complexity of O(n^2), which makes it inefficient for large lists.
- Selection Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, which means it doesn't require any extra memory to sort the list.
- It is a stable sorting algorithm, which means it doesn't change the relative order of elements that have equal values.
- Selection Sort is not adaptive, which means it performs the same number of comparisons and swaps regardless of the input order.
- It is not efficient for sorting large data sets, but it can be useful for small data sets or as part of other more complex sorting algorithms.
