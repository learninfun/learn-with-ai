Trie data structure is a tree-based data structure that enables fast and efficient search operations by providing excellent search time complexity. A trie represents a set of strings as a tree, where each node represents a character in the string. In other words, each node contains some value and a set of child nodes, where each child node represents the next character in the string. 

For example, consider the following set of words: cat, car, cone, core. 

The trie data structure for this set of words would look like: 

          Root
        /  /   \   \ 
       c  a   o    o
      /  / \   \    \
     a  r   t   n    r
       /     \      / \
      t       e    e   e


Here, the root node represents the empty string, and each child node represents a corresponding letter in the input words. The nodes marked in green represent the end of words. So, by traversing the trie, we can retrieve all the words present in it. 

Trie data structure is commonly used for word-related operations such as searching, autocompletion, and prediction. It provides a fast and efficient mechanism for searching words with the least amount of overhead. Additionally, because of its tree-based structure, it also helps in reducing memory usage and storage requirements.
