Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) is a classical problem in Computer Science that seeks to find the longest subsequence that is common to two or more sequences.

A subsequence is any subset of a sequence that preserves the relative order of the elements in the sequence. For example, if we have the sequence "abcdefg", the subsequences "aceg", "bcd", and "defg" are valid.

To find the LCS between two sequences, we need to identify all the subsequences that are common to both sequences, and then select the longest one. For example, if we have the sequences "ACADB" and "CBDA", the longest common subsequence is "CBA".

This problem is particularly relevant in fields such as bioinformatics, where we need to find the similarities and differences between DNA or protein sequences. Algorithms such as dynamic programming are commonly used to solve this problem in an efficient way.
