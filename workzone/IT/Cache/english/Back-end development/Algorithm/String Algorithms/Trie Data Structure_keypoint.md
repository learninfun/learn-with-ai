1. Trie is a tree-like data structure used for fast string operations like search, insertion and deletion.
2. It consists of nodes and edges, where each node represents a single character of the string and each edge connects a node with its child nodes.
3. The root node represents an empty string and each leaf node represents a complete word.
4. Trie is efficient in space as well as time complexity. Searching, insertion and deletion can be done in O(m) time where m is the length of the string.
5. It can be used in applications like auto-complete, spell check, and routing algorithms.
6. Tries don't support partial searching or searching for similar words.
7. Tries can be optimized with compression techniques to reduce space complexity.
