1. What is the main advantage of the Boyer-Moore algorithm over other string-searching algorithms?
Answer: The Boyer-Moore algorithm has an average-case complexity of O(n/m) where n is the length of the string being searched and m is the length of the pattern being searched for. This makes it significantly faster than other algorithms in most cases.

2. How does the Boyer-Moore algorithm handle cases where the pattern being searched for has repeated characters?
Answer: The algorithm uses two arrays (bad character and good suffix) to determine how far the pattern can be shifted to align with the current position in the text. If the pattern has repeated characters, the algorithm will use the array values corresponding to the farthest occurrence of that character.

3. What is the difference between the bad character and good suffix arrays used in the Boyer-Moore algorithm?
Answer: The bad character array uses the last occurrence of a character in the pattern to determine how far to shift the pattern when a mismatch occurs. The good suffix array uses the length of the longest suffix (a sequence of characters at the end of the pattern) that matches a prefix (a sequence of characters at the beginning of the pattern).

4. Can the Boyer-Moore algorithm be used for searching in multiple patterns?
Answer: Yes, the Boyer-Moore algorithm can be extended to search for multiple patterns at once. This is done by creating a trie data structure from the patterns and using it to guide the search.

5. Under what conditions does the Boyer-Moore algorithm have a worst-case complexity of O(nm)?
Answer: The Boyer-Moore algorithm has a worst-case complexity of O(nm) when the pattern being searched has many repeated characters and there are many occurrences of the pattern within the text. This can cause the algorithm to have to shift the pattern back by a large amount for each occurrence, resulting in significant time complexity.
