1. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

2. An increasing subsequence is a subsequence in which the elements are in increasing order.

3. The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the longest increasing subsequence in a given sequence.

4. The LIS problem can be solved using dynamic programming.

5. The basic idea of the dynamic programming approach is to maintain an array that stores the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each element of the sequence.

6. Initially, the length of the LIS for each element in the sequence is set to 1.

7. For each element in the sequence, we determine the length of the LIS ending at that element by checking the lengths of the LIS ending at all of the previous elements that are smaller than the current element.

8. The length of the LIS for the current element is then set to one plus the maximum of these lengths.

9. The final answer is the maximum value in the array that stores the length of the LIS ending at each element in the sequence.
