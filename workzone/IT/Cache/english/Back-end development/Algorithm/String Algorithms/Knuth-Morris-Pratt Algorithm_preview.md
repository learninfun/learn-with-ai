1. What is the Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm and what problem does it solve?

2. How does the Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm improve upon the naive pattern-matching algorithm?

3. What is the role of the "failure function" in the Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm and how does it work?

4. How does the Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm perform in worst-case and average-case scenarios, and why?
