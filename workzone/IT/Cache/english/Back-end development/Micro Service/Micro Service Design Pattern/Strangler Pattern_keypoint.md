1. The Strangler Pattern is a software architecture pattern that enables the gradual replacement of legacy systems with new ones, without disrupting the existing workflows and customer experience.

2. The core idea of the Strangler Pattern is to create a new system that absorbs the functionalities of the old one, bit by bit, until the legacy system has been entirely replaced.

3. To implement the Strangler Pattern, developers create a facade layer around the legacy system, which enables the redirection of traffic to the new system without compromising the user's experience or workflow.

4. The Strangler Pattern works best when the legacy system is modular and loosely coupled, enabling the replacement of each component or module incrementally, without affecting the other parts.

5. The Strangler Pattern is also useful in situations where the existing system is too complex to replace entirely within a limited period.

6. Advantages of the Strangler Pattern include the reduction of risks associated with the complete replacement of a legacy system and the ability to deliver value to users gradually.

7. Potential disadvantages of the Strangler Pattern include the increased complexity of having two systems running in tandem, and the need for careful planning to ensure a smooth transition.
