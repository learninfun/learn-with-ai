Linux Security refers to the set of measures taken to protect a Linux-based system from unauthorized access, unauthorized modifications, and other security threats. It includes a combination of technical solutions, such as encryption, firewalls, access control, and intrusion detection, as well as operational practices, such as user authentication, software updates, and backups.

An example of Linux security is the use of a firewall to block unauthorized access to network ports on a Linux server. Firewalls allow only specific traffic to enter a network based on predefined policies, preventing undue access and potential security breaches. Another example of Linux security is the use of access control measures, such as password policies and user permissions, to control who can access certain files and directories on the system. These measures help prevent unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data or services residing on the system.
