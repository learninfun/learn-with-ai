Hyper-V, also known as Microsoft Hyper-V or Windows Server Virtualization, is a virtualization platform that allows users to create and manage virtual machines (VMs) on their Windows-based systems. Hyper-V enables users to run multiple operating systems or applications on a single physical server, resulting in increased flexibility, scalability, and resource utilization.

For example, if a company wants to test software applications or configure different server environments, they can create several VMs and run them all on one physical server using Hyper-V. This eliminates the need for multiple physical servers and simplifies maintenance and management. Additionally, in the event of a hardware failure, Hyper-V allows users to quickly and easily move VMs to other physical servers without significant downtime.
