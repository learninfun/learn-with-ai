1. What are some common techniques used in a DoS attack?

- Some common techniques used in a DoS attack include TCP SYN floods, ping floods, and UDP floods. 

2. How does a DoS protection service work?

- A DoS protection service typically works by analyzing incoming traffic to detect traffic patterns that indicate a DoS attack. It may also use techniques such as rate limiting or traffic shaping to prevent the attack from overwhelming the target system.

3. What are some limitations of DoS protection services?

- Limitations of DoS protection services include the fact that they may not be able to protect against new or novel types of attacks, and that they may add latency to legitimate traffic. 

4. How can organizations best prepare for a DoS attack?

- Organizations can best prepare for a DoS attack by having a comprehensive incident response plan in place, performing regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing, and ensuring that critical systems are redundantly configured to handle high volumes of traffic. 

5. How can cloud-based DoS protection differ from on-premises solutions?

- Cloud-based DoS protection services may be better suited to handling large-scale attacks that could overwhelm on-premises solutions, since cloud providers have more bandwidth and resources available. However, on-premises solutions may be more effective at mitigating attacks that target specific applications or services hosted within an organization's network.
