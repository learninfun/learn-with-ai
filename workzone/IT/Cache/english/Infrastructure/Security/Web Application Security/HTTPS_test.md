1. What is HTTPS and how does it differ from HTTP? 

Answer: HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a protocol used for secure data communication over the internet. It is a more secure version of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which relies on unsecured communication. HTTPS encrypts all data transmitted between a client and server, making it more difficult for hackers to intercept and access sensitive information. 

2. How does HTTPS ensure secure communication? 

Answer: HTTPS uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols to encrypt the data transmitted between a client and server. This encryption ensures that even if a hacker intercepts the communication, they won't be able to read or understand the data. 

3. Why is HTTPS important for e-commerce websites? 

Answer: E-commerce websites handle sensitive information such as credit card numbers, personal information, and order details. Without HTTPS, this information is vulnerable to interception and theft by hackers. HTTPS encrypts this information, making it more difficult for hackers to access and misuse. 

4. What is a digital certificate and how is it used in HTTPS? 

Answer: A digital certificate is an electronic document used to verify the identity of a website. It is issued by a trusted authority and contains information about the website owner, the website's public key, and the certificate's expiration date. In HTTPS, the digital certificate is used to encrypt data and authenticate the server to the client. 

5. How can you test if a website is using HTTPS? 

Answer: To test if a website is using HTTPS, look for a padlock icon in the browser address bar. The URL of the website should also start with "https://" instead of "http://". Additionally, you can use online tools such as Qualys SSL Labs or SSL Checker to check if a website's SSL certificate is valid and up-to-date.
