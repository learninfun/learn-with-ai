1. What is Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)?
Answer: CSRF is an attack against web applications that tricks users into submitting unauthorized requests to a web application. The attack forces a victim's browser to perform an action that the attacker intends, such as transferring funds or changing a password.

2. How does CSRF work?
Answer: A CSRF attack involves an attacker tricking a victim into performing an action on a website without the victim's knowledge or consent. This is typically achieved by sending a malicious link or script to the victim via email or a social networking site, which redirects the victim to a website that has been compromised by the attacker.

3. How can CSRF attacks be prevented?
Answer: CSRF can be prevented by implementing measures such as the use of anti-CSRF tokens or "nonce" values, which are unique identifiers that are generated by the server and included in each request. Other prevention measures include limiting the use of cookies, using encrypted session cookies, and validating user input.

4. What is the difference between CSRF and XSS?
Answer: CSRF is an attack that targets a user's web session by forcing the user's browser to execute a malicious action against a web application. XSS, on the other hand, is an attack that involves injecting malicious code into a web page that is viewed by other users, often with the intent of stealing sensitive information or performing unauthorized actions.

5. What are the consequences of a successful CSRF attack?
Answer: The consequences of a CSRF attack can range from mild to severe, depending on the type of action that the attacker is able to perform. For example, a successful CSRF attack could result in the theft of sensitive information, the unauthorized transfer of funds, or the spread of malware to other users. These consequences can result in financial loss, reputational damage, and legal liability for the affected website or organization.
