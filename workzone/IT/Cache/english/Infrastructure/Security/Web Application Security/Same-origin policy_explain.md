The Same-origin policy is a security mechanism that restricts how different origins of web content can interact with each other in a web browser. The policy is enforced by web browsers to prevent malicious attacks such as the theft of sensitive information or the hijacking of user sessions. The same-origin policy requires that web requests made by scripts such as JavaScript, XMLHttpRequest, or Ajax should only be allowed to communicate with the same origin (host, port, and protocol) as the original source webpage that created the request.

For example, a website with the origin "https://www.example.com" cannot access content or information on another website with the origin "https://www.anotherexample.com". However, a webpage with the origin "https://www.example.com" can load resources or make requests to a sub-domain of the same origin such as "https://sub.example.com".

The same-origin policy provides an essential layer of security that helps to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources while browsing the web.
