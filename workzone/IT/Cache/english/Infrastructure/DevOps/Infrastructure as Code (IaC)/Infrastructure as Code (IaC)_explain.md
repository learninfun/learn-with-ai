Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is an approach to managing and provisioning IT infrastructure in which infrastructure components such as servers, networks, and storage are defined and managed using code. This code can be versioned, tested, and even automated, just like any other software code.

IaC involves using tools like Puppet, Chef, Ansible or Terraform, to write code that automate provisioning and maintenance of infrastructure components. This code can then be deployed to create, update or delete infrastructure resources in a consistent and repeatable manner.

An example of IaC is Terraform, where you can define your infrastructure as code using a domain-specific language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). For instance, you can define your resources like virtual machines, networks, and load balancers in a Terraform file, commits the changes to a Version Control System, and then deploy it to provision and manage your infrastructure.
