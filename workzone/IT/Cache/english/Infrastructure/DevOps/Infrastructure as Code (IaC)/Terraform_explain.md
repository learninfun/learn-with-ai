Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that is used to automate infrastructure management. It allows users to define and declare infrastructure resources, like servers, storage, networks, and services, using a high-level configuration language, resulting in a reproducible and consistent environment.

For example, let's say you want to create a web application infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Terraform can be used to define and provision the infrastructure, including EC2 instances, load balancer, and database, all using a Terraform configuration file. The Terraform configuration file describes the required resources in code, and is written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), a JSON-compatible domain-specific language. Terraform then applies this configuration, creates the necessary resources on AWS, and reports any errors or issues.

In summary, Terraform is a tool that makes it easier to manage infrastructure configurations, simplifying the process of provisioning and managing infrastructure resources.
