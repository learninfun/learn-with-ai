DevOps is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and integration between development and IT operations teams to automate the software delivery process, accelerate deployment cycles, and ensure higher overall quality of software products. DevOps integrates cultural, organizational, and technical aspects of software development and deployment to optimize the delivery process.

For example, suppose a team of developers is working on building a new application. They use a DevOps approach to ensure that the application is delivered quickly and efficiently. The developers work with the operations team to create a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. The pipeline automates the build, test, and deploy process, allowing developers to focus on writing code and reducing the chances of errors or bugs. The operations team monitors the application's performance and alerts the developers of any issues. The result is a faster, more reliable, and higher quality application.
