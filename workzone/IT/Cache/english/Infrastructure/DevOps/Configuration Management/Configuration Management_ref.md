Sorry, as a language model AI, I don't have the access to browse the internet to look for webpages. However, below are some information about Configuration Management:


Configuration management is a set of processes and tools used to manage, track, and control changes to software and hardware components throughout the software development lifecycle. It enables developers to keep track of changes made to software and hardware components, as well as ensure that these changes are made in a controlled manner, minimizing the risk of errors and ensuring that the software or hardware remains stable and reliable.

Some important aspects of configuration management include version control, build management, release management, and deployment automation. Version control allows developers to keep track of changes made to software code and ensure that these changes are made in a controlled manner. Build management is the process of building the software from source code, while release management involves planning and coordinating the release of software to production environments. Deployment automation helps to streamline the process of deploying software changes to production environments.

Configuration management tools such as Git, Subversion, and Jenkins can help developers automate the process of managing changes to software code and components, enabling them to focus on developing new features and functionality instead of spending time manually managing configuration changes. By using these tools, organizations can improve the overall quality and reliability of their software, as well as reduce the risk of errors and downtime.
