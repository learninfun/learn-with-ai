1. Linear data structures store data elements in a linear or sequential manner.
2. The elements in a linear data structure can be accessed in a specific sequence, i.e., in a straight line.
3. Examples of linear data structures are arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
4. Linear data structures can be implemented in a static or dynamic way.
5. In a static implementation, the size of the data structure is fixed at compile-time, and the size cannot be changed during program execution.
6. In a dynamic implementation, the size of the data structure can be varied during program execution.
7. Linear data structures are useful for storing and managing data in a variety of applications.
8. The choice of a linear data structure depends on the type of data, the operations that need to be performed on the data, and the efficiency of the structure for those operations.
