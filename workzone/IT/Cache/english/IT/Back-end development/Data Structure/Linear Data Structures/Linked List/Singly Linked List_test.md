1. What is a singly linked list?
Answer: A singly linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.

2. What is the time complexity for inserting a node at the beginning of a singly linked list?
Answer: The time complexity for inserting a node at the beginning of a singly linked list is O(1) as it involves updating just one pointer to point to the new node.

3. How do you remove the last node from a singly linked list?
Answer: To remove the last node from a singly linked list, you need to traverse the list until you reach the second last node, then update its next pointer to null.

4. What is the difference between a singly linked list and a doubly linked list?
Answer: A singly linked list only has a pointer to the next node in the sequence, while a doubly linked list has pointers to both the previous and next nodes in the sequence.

5. What is the advantage of using a singly linked list compared to an array?
Answer: The advantage of using a singly linked list is that it can be easily modified by inserting or deleting nodes without requiring the entire list to be shifted, which is time-consuming and inefficient for arrays.
