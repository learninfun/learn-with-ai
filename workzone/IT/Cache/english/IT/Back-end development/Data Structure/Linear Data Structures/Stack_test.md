1. What is a Stack data structure?
Answer: A Stack is a linear data structure where elements are stored in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) order.

2. What are the two fundamental operations of Stack?
Answer: The two fundamental operations of Stack are “push” and “pop”.

3. What is the time complexity of the “push” operation in a Stack?
Answer: The time complexity of the “push” operation is O(1).

4. How can you implement a Stack data structure in Python?
Answer: A Stack data structure can be implemented in Python using a list. The append() method is used for the “push” operation, and the pop() method is used for the “pop” operation.

5. What is the difference between a Stack and a Queue?
Answer: The main difference between a Stack and a Queue is the order in which elements are removed from the structure. In a Stack, the last element added (top element) is the first to be removed, whereas in a Queue, the first element added (front element) is the first to be removed (FIFO order).
