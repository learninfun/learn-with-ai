1. A linked list is a collection of nodes, each with a piece of data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

2. The first node in a linked list is called the head, and the last node is called the tail.

3. Linked lists can be singly-linked, where each node only references the next node in the sequence, or doubly-linked, where each node also references the previous node.

4. Linked lists can be used to implement dynamic data structures, such as stacks, queues, and hash tables.

5. Inserting or deleting a node in a linked list is efficient, as it only requires modifying the references of adjacent nodes.

6. Accessing a particular node in a linked list is less efficient than in an array or ArrayList, as it requires traversing the list from the head or tail to find the desired node.

7. Linked lists are not suitable for applications that require random access to elements, as they do not support direct indexing.

8. Linked lists can be used to implement sorting algorithms, such as merge sort and insertion sort, which depend on efficient merging and splitting of sequences.
