A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element in the list is stored as a node, consisting of two parts: data and a reference (or a pointer) to the next node in the list. The last node in the list points to null to indicate the end of the list. 

Here is an example of a singly linked list:

Head --> [5 | Next -->] --> [10 | Next -->] --> [15 | Next -->] --> [20 | Next -->] --> Null

In this example, we have a linked list with four nodes, where the data values of the nodes are 5, 10, 15, and 20. The first node in the list, the head, points to the first node with the data value of 5. The next pointer of the first node points to the second node with the data value of 10, and so on, until the last node with the data value of 20, which points to null. 

Singly linked lists are commonly used to implement other data structures, such as stacks, queues, and hash tables, as well as for dynamic memory allocation in programming languages.
