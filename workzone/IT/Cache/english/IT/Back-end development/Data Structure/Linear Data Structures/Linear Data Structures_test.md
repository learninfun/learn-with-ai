1. What is the time complexity for accessing an element in an array? 
Answer: O(1)

2. What is the difference between a linked list and an array? 
Answer: A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes that are linked to each other, while elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations.

3. What is the time complexity to delete an element in a singly linked list? 
Answer: O(n)

4. Can a circular linked list be implemented as a doubly linked list? 
Answer: Yes, a circular linked list can be implemented as a doubly linked list by adding a previous pointer to each node and connecting the last node to the first node.

5. What is the time complexity to search for an element in a binary search tree? 
Answer: O(log n)
