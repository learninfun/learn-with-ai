1. What is a queue in computer science?
Answer: A queue is a data structure that stores a collection of elements in a specific order, such that the first element added is the first one to be removed.

2. What is the difference between a queue and a stack?
Answer: A stack is a data structure that follows the "last in, first out" (LIFO) principle, whereas a queue follows the "first in, first out" (FIFO) principle.

3. What is the time complexity of adding an item to a queue?
Answer: The time complexity of adding an item to a queue is O(1), which means it takes constant time to add an element to the end of the queue.

4. How can you implement a queue using an array?
Answer: To implement a queue using an array, you can use two pointers - one pointing to the front of the queue and the other pointing to the end. When you add an element, you increment the end pointer, and when you remove an element, you increment the front pointer.

5. What is a priority queue?
Answer: A priority queue is a type of queue in which each element is assigned a priority value, and the element with the highest priority is always removed first, regardless of the order in which it was added.
