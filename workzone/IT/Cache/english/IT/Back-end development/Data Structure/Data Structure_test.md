1. What is the difference between a stack and a queue in data structures?
Answer: A stack is a data structure where elements are arranged in a LIFO (Last-in, First-out) order, whereas a queue is a data structure where elements are arranged in a FIFO (First-in, First-out) order.

2. What is a binary tree in data structures?
Answer: A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, left and right. The left child is always less than the right child.

3. How do you find the middle element of a linked list?
Answer: To find the middle element of a linked list, we can use the two-pointer technique. We will use two pointers, one moving at twice the speed of the other, and when the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle.

4. What is a hash table in data structures?
Answer: A hash table is a data structure that associates keys with values. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

5. What is the time complexity of inserting an element in an AVL tree?
Answer: The time complexity of inserting an element in an AVL tree is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we need to traverse the tree to find the correct position for the new node, and then rebalance the tree as necessary.
