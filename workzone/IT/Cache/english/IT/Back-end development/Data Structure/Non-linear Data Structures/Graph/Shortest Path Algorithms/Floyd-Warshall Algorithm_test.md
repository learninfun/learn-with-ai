1) What is the time complexity of Floyd-Warshall Algorithm?
Answer: The time complexity of Floyd-Warshall Algorithm is O(N^3), where N is the number of vertices in the graph.

2) What is the purpose of using the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm?
Answer: The Floyd-Warshall Algorithm is used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.

3) Can the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm be used on graphs with negative cycles? If not, why?
Answer: No, the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm cannot be used on graphs with negative cycles because it leads to an infinite loop while finding the shortest path.

4) How does the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm work?
Answer: The Floyd-Warshall Algorithm works by considering all possible routes between pairs of vertices in a weighted graph and updating the shortest distance between any two vertices.

5) Is the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm guaranteed to find the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph?
Answer: Yes, the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm is guaranteed to find the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph, provided there are no negative cycles in the graph.
