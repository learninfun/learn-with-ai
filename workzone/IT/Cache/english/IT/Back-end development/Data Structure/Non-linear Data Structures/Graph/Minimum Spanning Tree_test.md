1. What is a minimum spanning tree?

Answer: A minimum spanning tree is a subset of edges in an undirected, weighted graph that connects all vertices with minimum possible total edge weight.

2. What is Kruskal's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree?

Answer: Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree by sorting the edges of the graph by weight and adding them to the minimum spanning tree one at a time, avoiding cycles.

3. What is Prim's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree?

Answer: Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree by starting from an arbitrary vertex and adding the closest edge to the minimum spanning tree, until all vertices are included.

4. What is the time complexity of Kruskal's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree?

Answer: The time complexity of Kruskal's algorithm is O(E log E), where E is the number of edges in the graph.

5. What is the time complexity of Prim's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree?

Answer: The time complexity of Prim's algorithm is O(E log V), where E is the number of edges in the graph and V is the number of vertices.
