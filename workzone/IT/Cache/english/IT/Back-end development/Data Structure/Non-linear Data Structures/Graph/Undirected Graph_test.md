1. What is the difference between an undirected graph and a directed graph?
Answer: An undirected graph is a graph in which the edges do not have a direction, while a directed graph has edges with a specific direction.

2. What is the degree of a vertex in an undirected graph?
Answer: The degree of a vertex in an undirected graph is the number of edges that connect to that vertex.

3. How do you find the shortest path between two vertices in an undirected graph?
Answer: One common algorithm for finding the shortest path in an undirected graph is Dijkstra's algorithm.

4. What is a connected component in an undirected graph?
Answer: A connected component in an undirected graph is a subgraph in which every pair of vertices is connected by a path.

5. What is a cycle in an undirected graph?
Answer: A cycle in an undirected graph is a sequence of vertices and edges that starts and ends at the same vertex, and in which there are no repeated edges.
