1. Non-linear data structures don't have a predefined order and don't follow a linear sequence like arrays and lists do. 

2. They allow for more complex relationships between data, such as hierarchical or interconnected structures like trees or graphs. 

3. Non-linear structures have nodes, which contain data or elements, and links or edges, which connect the nodes. 

4. Trees are a type of non-linear data structure that have a root node and branches off of it. 

5. Graphs allow for more complex relationships between nodes, with nodes connected by edges that represent different types of relationships or connections. 

6. Hash tables and hash maps are another type of non-linear structure that use key-value pairs instead of nodes and links. 

7. Non-linear structures can be more memory-efficient than linear structures in certain situations, but may also be slower to search or manipulate. 

8. Applications of non-linear data structures include computer networking, database management, and natural language processing.
