An undirected graph is a graph where edges do not have direction or arrows. In other words, the connection between two vertices is bi-directional. If vertex A is connected to vertex B, it means vertex B can also reach vertex A without any restrictions.  

An example of an undirected graph is a social network. The individuals in the network can be represented as vertices, and each connection or friendship between two individuals can be represented as an undirected edge. The graph can also have edges representing groups, clubs or organizations that these individuals belong to. This type of graph is useful in understanding how people are connected and can help identify groups or sub-communities within a network.
