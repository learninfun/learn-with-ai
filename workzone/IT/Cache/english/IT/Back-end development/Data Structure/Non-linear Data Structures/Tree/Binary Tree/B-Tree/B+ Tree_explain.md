A B+ tree is a type of balanced tree data structure used for indexing and searching large amounts of data in databases and file systems. It is similar to a B-tree but with some differences, including the fact that all the data is stored in the leaves of the tree, which are linked together in a sorted order. The internal nodes of the tree contain only keys and pointers to other nodes, which allows for fast searches and efficient data retrieval.

An example of a B+ tree would be a database index for a large online shopping website. The index would contain millions of records, each with a unique identifier (such as a product code or SKU) and a corresponding pointer to the actual data stored on disk. The index would be organized as a B+ tree, with the root node containing pointers to the first level of internal nodes, which in turn link to the leaves where the actual data is stored. Searches for specific products or categories would be performed by traversing the tree from the root to the appropriate leaf, with each internal node acting as a filter to narrow down the search. This allows for very fast and efficient querying of large amounts of data.
