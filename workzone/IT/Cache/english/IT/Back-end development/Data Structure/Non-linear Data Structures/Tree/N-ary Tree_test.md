1. What is an N-ary tree?
Answer: An N-ary tree is a tree-like data structure in which each node has at most N children.

2. What is the maximum number of children that the root node in an N-ary tree can have?
Answer: The maximum number of children that the root node in an N-ary tree can have is N.

3. How is an N-ary tree different from a binary tree?
Answer: An N-ary tree can have more than two children per node, whereas a binary tree can have at most two children per node.

4. Can an N-ary tree have nodes with different numbers of children?
Answer: Yes, an N-ary tree can have nodes with different numbers of children.

5. What is the maximum height of an N-ary tree with N children per node?
Answer: The maximum height of an N-ary tree with N children per node is given by the equation h = logn(N^(n+1)-1)/(N-1), where h is the height and n is the number of nodes.
