1. What is the height of a binary tree with 7 nodes?
Answer: The height of a binary tree with 7 nodes can range from 2 to 3 levels depending on the arrangement of nodes within the tree.

2. What is a binary search tree, and what is its purpose?
Answer: A binary search tree is a type of binary tree where every node's left child is less than the parent, and every right child is greater than the parent. It is used to implement searching algorithms efficiently.

3. How do you delete a node from a binary tree?
Answer: To delete a node from a binary tree, you must first find the node to be deleted. Then, move its right subtree to the parent of the node, and find the leftmost node of the right subtree to attach to the end. Finally, remove the node.

4. What is the difference between a binary tree and a binary search tree?
Answer: A binary tree is a tree where each node can have at most two children. A binary search tree is a binary tree where each node's left child is less than the parent, and every right child is greater than the parent.

5. What is a height-balanced binary tree?
Answer: A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree where the difference in height between the left and right subtrees of every node is at most one.
