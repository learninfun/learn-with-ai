1. A trie is a tree-based data structure used for efficient storing and retrieving of strings.

2. Each node in a trie represents a character, and the path from the root to the node represents a string.

3. Tries are useful for solving problems that involve searching for words or string patterns.

4. Tries support insertion and deletion of strings, as well as partial matching and finding all strings that match a given pattern.

5. The time complexity of inserting and searching in a trie is proportional to the length of the string being inserted or searched for.

6. Tries can be used for implementing string dictionaries, spell checkers, and other text processing applications.

7. A compressed trie can be used to reduce the space complexity of storing the trie without sacrificing the retrieval efficiency.
