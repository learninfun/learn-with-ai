1. What is an AVL tree?
Answer: AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that maintains the balance factor between -1 to +1 in each node.

2. How does AVL tree maintain its balance?
Answer: AVL tree maintains its balance by performing rotation operations when the balance factor is greater than 1 or less than -1 in any node.

3. What is the time complexity of inserting a node in AVL tree?
Answer: The time complexity of inserting a node in an AVL tree is O(log n), where n is the total number of nodes in the tree.

4. Can two AVL trees have the same set of elements but different structures?
Answer: Yes, two AVL trees can have the same set of elements but different structures.

5. What is the height of an AVL tree with n nodes?
Answer: The height of an AVL tree with n nodes is O(log n).
