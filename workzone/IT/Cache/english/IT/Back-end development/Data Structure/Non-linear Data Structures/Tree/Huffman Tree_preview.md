1. How does a Huffman tree compress data?
2. How do you create a Huffman tree for a set of data?
3. How does the frequency of characters in the data impact the resulting Huffman tree?
4. Can a Huffman tree be used to decompress data as well as compress it?
5. How does the size of the Huffman tree compare to other compression algorithms, such as LZW or RLE?
