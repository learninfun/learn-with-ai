1. Data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer program or system.
2. Different data structures have their own characteristics, advantages, and limitations.
3. The most common data structures are arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.
4. The choice of a data structure depends on the type of problem one is trying to solve and the performance requirements of the program.
5. The efficiency of algorithms depends on the data structure used to store and manipulate data.
6. Key operations on data structures include insertion, deletion, traversal, searching, and sorting.
7. Data structures often have associated algorithms for performing these operations efficiently.
8. Data structures play a vital role in designing and implementing software applications, databases, and file systems.
