1. JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity and is used to establish a connection between Java applications and databases.
2. JDBC is a standardized API for accessing databases that use SQL (Structured Query Language).
3. It provides a way for Java programs to interact with most types of databases, regardless of the underlying database technology.
4. JDBC drivers are used to connect to the database and provide a way for Java programs to execute SQL statements and retrieve data.
5. There are four types of JDBC drivers: Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, and Type 4. Type 4 drivers are the most common and are typically used for web applications.
6. JDBC provides a set of interfaces and classes that enable Java programs to perform database operations such as creating, updating, deleting, and querying data.
7. JDBC supports transaction management, which ensures that database operations are completed as a single unit of work.
8. JDBC also provides support for metadata, which enables Java programs to retrieve information about the database such as table and column names, data types, and more.
9. JDBC provides a way for Java programs to interact with stored procedures, which are precompiled database objects that can be called from within a SQL statement.
10. JDBC enables Java programs to work with multiple result sets generated by a single query. These result sets can be iterated over and processed independently.
