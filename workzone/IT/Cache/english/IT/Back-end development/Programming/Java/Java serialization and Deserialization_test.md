1) What is Java Serialization?
Answer: Java Serialization is a mechanism in Java that allows an object to be converted into a byte stream, which can be transmitted or stored on a file system.

2) What is Deserialization in Java?
Answer: Deserialization in Java is the reverse process of Serialization, where the byte stream is converted back into an object of the original class.

3) What is the purpose of implementing the Serializable interface in Java?
Answer: The Serializable interface in Java is used to mark the object as serializable, which tells the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that the object can be converted into a byte stream.

4) What are the potential issues with Java Serialization?
Answer: The potential issues with Java Serialization include versioning, security concerns, and the possibility of class incompatibilities between different versions of the same class.

5) How can you prevent serialized objects from being tampered with during transmission?
Answer: You can prevent serialized objects from being tampered with during transmission by using digital signatures or encryption techniques to secure the byte stream.
