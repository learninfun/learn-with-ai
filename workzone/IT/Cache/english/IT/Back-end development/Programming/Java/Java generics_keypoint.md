1. Java generics were introduced in Java 5 to provide type safety and parameterized types.
2. They enable classes, interfaces, and methods to work with any data type.
3. They enable compile-time type checking which helps in identifying and fixing errors during the development phase.
4. Generics use type parameter, which is a placeholder for the actual type that will be used at runtime.
5. Usage of generics reduces the need for explicit casts and enhances code readability.
6. Generics can be used with collections, interfaces, classes, methods, and constructors. 
7. Wildcards are used in generics to provide more flexibility- Upper Bounded, Lower Bounded, and Unbounded.
8. Generic types retain their type information at runtime through a mechanism called Type Erasure.
9. Typed Collection classes like ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, and Vector are prime examples that use generics to ensure type safety.
