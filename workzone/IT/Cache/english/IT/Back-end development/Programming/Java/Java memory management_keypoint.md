1. Java uses automatic memory management, also known as garbage collection, to manage memory allocation and deallocation.
2. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) divides memory into two sections: heap and stack.
3. The heap is where all Java objects are allocated, whereas the stack is where local variables and method parameters are stored.
4. Java objects are created using the new operator, which allocates memory from the heap.
5. Java provides a range of methods to control memory, including garbage collection methods, heap size configuration, and profiling tools.
6. The garbage collector runs periodically to identify and remove objects that are no longer being used by the program, freeing up memory for other objects to use.
7. There are various garbage collection algorithms, including mark and sweep, copying, and generational garbage collection.
8. Java allows for manual memory management using native or unsafe code, but this is generally not recommended except in specific cases where performance is critical.
9. Good memory management practices are important for preventing memory leaks and improving application performance. These include making efficient use of memory, minimizing object creation, and avoiding unnecessary object retention.
