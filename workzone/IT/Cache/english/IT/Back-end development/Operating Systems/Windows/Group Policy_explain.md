Group Policy is a feature in the Windows operating system that allows administrators to manage and control the configuration settings of multiple computers or users in a network. It is a set of rules and settings that can be applied to multiple computers or users at once, ensuring consistency and control across the network.

For example, if an organization wants to enforce a password policy to improve security, they can create a Group Policy that mandates all users to have strong passwords that include a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. This Group Policy can be applied to all users in the domain, ensuring that all users follow the same password policy.

Another example of Group Policy is restricting access to certain features or applications. For instance, an IT administrator can create a Group Policy that disables access to social media sites during working hours to improve productivity. This Group Policy can be enforced on all computers or users in the domain.
