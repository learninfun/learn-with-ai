PowerShell is a command-line interface (CLI) shell designed for automating system administration tasks and scripting. It's built on top of the .NET framework and shares much of the same syntax and commands as .NET.

An example of a PowerShell command is:

Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users | Where-Object {$_.LastWriteTime -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(-30)} | Sort-Object LastWriteTime | Select-Object FullName, LastWriteTime

This command recursively lists all files and folders in the C:\Users directory, filters only those that haven't been modified in the last 30 days, sorts them by last modification date, and displays the full path and date of the remaining files. This is just one example of the many tasks PowerShell can accomplish efficiently and easily.
