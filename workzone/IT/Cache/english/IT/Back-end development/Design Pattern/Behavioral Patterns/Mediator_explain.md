Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that helps to define an object that encapsulates communication between different objects or components, thus minimizing direct dependencies and enabling a more flexible and simplified interaction. This pattern is aimed at reducing coupling between objects by introducing a third-party object, the mediator, that controls and coordinates the communication among them.

Here is an example of the mediator pattern in action:

Suppose you are developing a chat application where several users can communicate with each other through different chat rooms. In this scenario, the chat room object can act as a mediator that coordinates the communication between different users.

Instead of letting every user directly send messages to each other, they need to send their messages to the chat room object, which takes care of delivering them to the appropriate recipients.

This way, the chat room object becomes an intermediary that manages and organizes the flow of messages within a certain context, reducing the complexity and dependencies among the users.

Through the mediator pattern, the chat application is more scalable, modular, and easier to maintain, as any changes or new functionality can be added to the mediator without affecting or changing other components' behavior.
