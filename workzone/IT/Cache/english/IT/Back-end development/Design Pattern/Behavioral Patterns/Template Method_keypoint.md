1. Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that allows defining a skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and letting subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

2. Template method helps to eliminate repetitive code in related classes and promotes code reuse.

3. The pattern consists of two key components: an abstract base class and one or more concrete subclasses.

4. The base class contains a template method that defines the high-level algorithm, and one or more abstract methods (known as "hooks") that allow the subclasses to provide their own implementation for specific steps.

5. The concrete subclasses inherit from the base class and override the abstract methods to provide their own implementation for specific steps.

6. The template method guarantees the integrity of the algorithm by enforcing the order of execution for each step and preventing subclasses from changing the method signature.

7. Template method is commonly used in resource management, concurrency control, and stream processing applications.

8. Template method can make a code base more flexible, extensible and easier to maintain. 

9. However, its overuse can lead to complex class hierarchies and code duplication.
