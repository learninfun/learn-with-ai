1. What is the Template Method design pattern?
Answer: The Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, while allowing subclasses to override some steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

2. What problem does the Template Method pattern solve?
Answer: The Template Method pattern solves the problem of code duplication and the need for many similar algorithms with only small differences between each one.

3. What are the main components of the Template Method design pattern?
Answer: The main components of the Template Method pattern are the abstract base class (or template class), the concrete classes that implement the specific steps of the algorithm, and the hooks (or template methods) that allow subclasses to modify some parts of the algorithm.

4. How does the Template Method pattern differ from the Strategy pattern?
Answer: The Template Method pattern focuses on defining a fixed algorithm structure with optional hooks for customization, while the Strategy pattern defines interchangeable algorithms that can be selected and applied at runtime.

5. What are some real-world examples of the Template Method pattern?
Answer: Some examples of the Template Method pattern in real-world applications include compilers (with parsing and code generation stages), text editors (with different document types and file formats), and computer games (with different levels, enemies, and gameplay mechanics).
