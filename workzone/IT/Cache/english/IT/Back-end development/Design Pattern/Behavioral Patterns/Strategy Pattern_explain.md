The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables an object's behavior to be changed dynamically based on the state of the system. It defines a set of algorithms, encapsulates each one of them, and makes them interchangeable. The pattern enables the algorithms to be selected during runtime based on the context of the problem at hand.

For example, consider a graphics editor that needs to support multiple file formats for image output. The system needs to be able to save files in different image formats like PNG, JPG, BMP, and GIF. To support this, we can use the strategy pattern and create a strategy for each format. Each strategy would contain the code to save an image in that format.

The Code could be:

```
interface ImageSaveStrategy {
  void save(Image image, String filename);
}

class PNGStrategy implements ImageSaveStrategy {
  void save(Image image, String filename) {
    // Implementation of saving image as PNG
  }
}

class JPGStrategy implements ImageSaveStrategy {
  void save(Image image, String filename) {
    // Implementation of saving image as JPG
  }
}

class BMPStrategy implements ImageSaveStrategy {
  void save(Image image, String filename) {
    // Implementation of saving image as BMP
  }
}

class GIFStrategy implements ImageSaveStrategy {
  void save(Image image, String filename) {
    // Implementation of saving image as GIF
  }
}
```

In the client code, we can create and set the strategy at runtime, based on the required file format.

```
class ImageEditor {
  private ImageSaveStrategy strategy;

  public void setSaveStrategy(ImageSaveStrategy strategy) {
    this.strategy = strategy;
  }

  public void save(Image image, String filename) {
    strategy.save(image, filename);
  }
}
```

The actual strategy to be used will be determined dynamically by the ImageEditor class based on the user's preference or the default format specified by the system.
