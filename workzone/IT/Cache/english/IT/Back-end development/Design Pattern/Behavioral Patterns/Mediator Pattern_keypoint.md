1. Mediator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that is used to simplify the communication between a set of objects.

2. Multiple objects communicate with each other without having to know about each other by using a mediator object.

3. The mediator object acts as a coordinator between different objects in a system.

4. The mediator pattern improves the maintainability, scalability and testability of a system by reducing the dependencies between the different components.

5. The mediator pattern promotes loose coupling between objects and encourages good programming practices.

6. This pattern is appropriate when the objects in a system are complex and have many relationships with each other.

7. The mediator pattern can be implemented by creating a mediator class that encapsulates the interactions between objects, with methods for sending and receiving messages.

8. The mediator object can be implemented as a singleton, to ensure that there is only one instance of it in the system.

9. In a typical implementation, the mediator object passes messages between objects, and the objects can send and receive messages using the mediator as a conduit.

10. This pattern can be seen in many real-world scenarios, such as air traffic control systems or online marketplaces, where coordination between multiple components is necessary.
