Pattern:

1. The Observer Pattern is a design pattern for creating one-to-many relationships between objects.

2. It involves the use of an observable object, which notifies all of its observers when its internal state changes.

3. Observers are objects that are interested in the state of the observable object and register with it to receive updates.

4. Once an observer is registered, it receives updates automatically whenever the observable object changes.

5. The Observer Pattern is commonly used in user interfaces, where changes in one part of the interface need to be reflected in other parts of the interface.

6. The Observer Pattern is a powerful mechanism for decoupling objects and promoting loosely-coupled, highly-modular designs.

7. It is also important to note that there are several variations of the Observer Pattern, including the subject-observer pattern, the publish-subscribe pattern, and the event-driven pattern.
