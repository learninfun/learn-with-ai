1. What is the Observer Pattern?
Answer: The Observer Pattern is a design pattern that allows one-to-many relationships between objects. When the state of one object changes, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

2. What are the main components of the Observer pattern?
Answer: The main components of the Observer pattern are the Observable (also known as Subject), the Observer, and the Client.

3. What is the difference between the Push model and the Pull model in the Observer pattern?
Answer: In the Push model, the updates are sent proactively by the Observable to its Observers. In the Pull model, Observers request updates from the Observable when they need them.

4. How does the Observer pattern support loose coupling between objects?
Answer: By having the Observable and Observers interact only through a common interface, the Observer pattern allows for flexible and dynamic relationships between objects, as they can be easily added or removed without affecting the system's overall functionality.

5. Can the Observer pattern be used with multithreaded systems?
Answer: Yes, it can. However, proper synchronization mechanisms need to be put in place to ensure that each Observable and Observer operates on its own thread without causing conflicts or race conditions.
