1. What is the Facade Pattern?
A: The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.

2. What problem does the Facade Pattern solve?
A: The Facade Pattern simplifies the access to a complex subsystem by providing a higher-level interface that hides the details of the subsystem's components.

3. What are the main benefits of using the Facade Pattern?
A: The main benefits of using the Facade Pattern include simplifying the client code, reducing dependencies between the client and the subsystem, and facilitating the evolution of the subsystem's components.

4. How does the Facade Pattern relate to other design patterns?
A: The Facade Pattern is related to other patterns such as Adapter and Proxy, as it can be used to adapt a complex interface to a simpler one or to hide the complexity of a remote or virtual object.

5. How would you implement the Facade Pattern in your code?
A: To implement the Facade Pattern in your code, you would define a new class that provides a simplified interface to the subsystem's components, and delegate the calls from the client to the appropriate methods of the subsystem. You could also use the Facade Pattern to encapsulate the creation and configuration of the subsystem's objects, providing a higher-level interface that abstracts away the details of their initialization.
