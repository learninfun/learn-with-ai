1. What is the Structural Pattern that provides an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate?

2. Which Structural Pattern is used to create a one-to-many relationship between objects, where one object maintains a list of dependent objects and notifies them automatically of any changes to its state? 
Answer: The Observer pattern. 

3. Which Structural Pattern is used to provide a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, making it easy to use and understand for clients? 
Answer: The Facade pattern. 

4. What is the Structural Pattern that allows you to add new functionality to an object without changing its underlying structure, by wrapping it in a new object that provides the extra behavior? 
Answer: The Decorator pattern. 

5. Which Structural Pattern is used to define a family of related classes with a common interface, allowing these classes to be interchanged without affecting the client code that uses them?
