1. What is the Flyweight pattern and what problem does it solve?
Answer: The Flyweight pattern is a software design pattern that aims to reduce memory usage and improve performance by sharing common data between multiple objects. It solves the problem of having a large number of small objects that consume significant amounts of memory.

2. When should the Flyweight pattern be used?
Answer: The Flyweight pattern should be used when we need to create a large number of objects that have similar characteristics, especially if these objects are small and require significant resources to create. It can also be useful when we need to optimize memory usage, or when we want to improve performance by reducing the number of objects that need to be created.

3. What are the key components of the Flyweight pattern?
Answer: The key components of the Flyweight pattern are the Flyweight class, which represents the common state of multiple objects, and the Context class, which provides the unique state of each object. The FlyweightFactory class is responsible for creating and managing instances of the Flyweight class.

4. What is the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic state in the Flyweight pattern?
Answer: Intrinsic state is the common state shared by all instances of the Flyweight class, while extrinsic state is the unique state that is provided by the Context class. Intrinsic state is usually immutable and can be shared between multiple objects, while extrinsic state is mutable and needs to be provided by each object individually.

5. Can the Flyweight pattern be used in multithreaded environments?
Answer: Yes, the Flyweight pattern can be used in multithreaded environments, but proper synchronization mechanisms need to be put in place to ensure thread safety. One approach is to use a thread-safe FlyweightFactory class that ensures that only one instance of each Flyweight object is created, even in a multithreaded environment.
