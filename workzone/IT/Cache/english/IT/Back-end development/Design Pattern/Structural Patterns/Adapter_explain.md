An adapter refers to a software design pattern that allows two incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a common interface between them. In simpler words, it acts as a bridge between two systems to communicate and work in harmony.

For instance, let's say you have a charger that accepts a 3-pin plug, but you have a device that has a 2-pin plug. In this case, you will need an adapter that fits the device's plug and allows it to connect to the charger.

Similarly, in software engineering, an example of an adapter pattern is when a database adapter is used to extract data from a database using one format and convert it to another format that the application can use. This is often used when working with different databases or operating systems.
