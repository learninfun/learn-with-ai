1. What is Facade design pattern and why is it used?

Answer: Facade is a design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, such as a library or framework. It is used to make complex systems easier to use, understand and maintain.

2. How does Facade differ from other design patterns such as Adapter or Decorator?

Answer: While Adapter and Decorator modify the behavior of existing objects or classes, Facade provides a simple interface to a complex system without changing its behavior. It is focused on making the interface easier to use, rather than modifying the underlying code.

3. Can a single Facade interface provide access to multiple subsystems?

Answer: Yes, a single Facade interface can provide access to multiple subsystems. The Facade can act as a coordinating interface between different subsystems, providing a unified interface to the user.

4. Does Facade violate the principle of encapsulation?

Answer: No, Facade does not violate the principle of encapsulation. It simply provides a simplified interface to a complex system, while the internal workings of the system remain hidden from the user.

5. What are some examples of real-world applications of Facade design pattern?

Answer: Some real-world applications of Facade include web APIs, software libraries, and operating system interfaces, all of which provide a simplified interface to complex systems. Additionally, Facade can be used in user interfaces, where it provides a simplified view of a complex system or process.
