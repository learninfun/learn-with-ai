- Creational patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
- Creational patterns are not concerned with the impact of these objects on the performance of a system, but rather focus on the way objects can be created and managed to achieve better flexibility and maintainability.
- Creational patterns provide a way to create objects without revealing the creation logic, while maintaining the flexibility of the system.
- The key points of Creational Patterns include the Singleton pattern, Prototype pattern, Factory Method pattern, Abstract Factory pattern, Builder pattern, and Object Pool pattern.
- The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created, providing a global access point to this instance.
- The Prototype pattern creates new objects by cloning existing objects, avoiding costly initialization processes.
- The Factory Method pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, while allowing subclasses to alter the individual objects they create.
- The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related objects, without specifying their concrete classes.
- The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- The Object Pool pattern creates a pool of objects that can be reused instead of being created and destroyed every time they are needed, improving overall system performance.
