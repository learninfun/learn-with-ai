1. Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects being created.

2. It facilitates creating object instances without exposing the object creation logic.

3. It involves defining a separate method called the ‘Factory Method’ in the superclass that returns objects of the same ‘interface’ or ‘abstract class’.

4. The Factory Method is responsible for defining and creating the objects of the specific class that the Factory Pattern uses.

5. It helps in the separation of responsibilities between classes and improves code flexibility and extensibility.

6. It is an excellent pattern to use when you want to create objects that require a lot of computation or resources.

7. The Factory Pattern can be used with dependency injection, which resolves dependencies between different objects.

8. Some of the pros of using the Factory Pattern includes flexibility, maintainability, and scalability.

9. The Factory Pattern has some cons, including increased complexity, slower runtime, and difficulty in debugging.

10. There are different variations of the Factory Pattern including Simple Factory, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Static Factory, and Dependency Injection.
