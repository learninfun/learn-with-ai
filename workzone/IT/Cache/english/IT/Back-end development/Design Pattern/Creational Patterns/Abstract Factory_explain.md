Abstract Factory is a design pattern that is used to generate families of related objects, without having to specify their concrete classes. It provides an interface to create families of related objects, but without specifying the specific products its components will produce.

An example of Abstract Factory pattern is a graphical user interface toolkit, which can be implemented using Abstract Factory method. An interface is provided for creating an abstract widget factory, which can create different types of widgets such as buttons, text boxes, combo boxes, check boxes and so on. 
Different themes, like material design, windows, and iOS, can be defined as sub-classes of the widget factory. Each theme has its own implementation of createButton(), createTextBox() and so on. 

The client code, which creates the user interface, can use the abstract widget factory interface, and depending on which factory is chosen, it will create the required widgets with their respective theme (product). Therefore, Abstract Factory creates multiple related products using the same factory method.
