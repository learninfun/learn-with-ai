5) What are some potential drawbacks of using the Singleton pattern?
Answer: Some potential drawbacks of using Singleton pattern include tighter coupling within code, reduced flexibility, and increased difficulty in testing and debugging. Additionally, the Singleton pattern may be overused or misused in some cases.
