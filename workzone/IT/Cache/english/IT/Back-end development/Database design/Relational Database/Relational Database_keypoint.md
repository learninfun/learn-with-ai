1. Relational databases store data in a tabular format, with each table consisting of rows and columns.

2. Tables in a relational database are related to each other by means of commonly shared columns, called keys.

3. The primary key is the column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in the table. 

4. Foreign keys are used to link the data across two tables, thereby maintaining data integrity.

5. Relationships between tables are classified into primary-key-to-foreign-key relationships, one-to-one relationships, one-to-many relationships, and many-to-many relationships. 

6. Relational databases are based on the structured query language (SQL) for data manipulation, storage, and organization.

7. Relational databases require the use of a database management system (DBMS), which controls access to the data and ensures its integrity and security.

8. The core principles of a relational database include ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) and normalization techniques.

9. Relational databases are widely used, and there are numerous different types available, including Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.
