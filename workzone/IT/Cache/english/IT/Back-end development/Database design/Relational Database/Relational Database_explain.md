A relational database is a type of database that stores and organizes data in a way that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated according to the relationships among the different data elements. In a relational database, each data element is stored in a table as a row. Each table consists of columns, which are the attributes or characteristics of the data elements.

Here's an example: 

Let's assume we have a database for a school, and we want to store information about students and the courses they take.

We can create two tables: one for students and one for courses. 

The student table would have columns for the student's ID, name, age, and contact information. 

The course table would have columns for the course ID, name, description, and the instructor's name.

We can establish a relationship between these two tables by adding a new column to the course table, called "student ID." This column will store the ID of the student who is enrolled in the course. 

Now, we can join the student and course tables on the student ID column, and retrieve information about which students are taking which courses, and vice versa. 

For example, if we want to find out which courses a particular student is taking, we can use a SQL statement like this:

SELECT * FROM courses WHERE student_id = [student's ID];

This will return a list of all the courses that the student is currently enrolled in. 

The advantage of a relational database is that it allows us to retrieve data quickly and efficiently, and to establish relationships between different data elements in a way that reflects the real-world relationships between them.
