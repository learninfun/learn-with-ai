2. What are some common use cases for key-value stores?
Answer: Key-value stores are commonly used for caching and session management in web applications, as well as for storing user preferences and settings. They are also used in distributed systems and for real-time data processing.

3. What are some of the benefits of using a key-value store?
Answer: Key-value stores are typically more scalable and faster than traditional databases. They also offer flexibility in terms of data structure and can be easily integrated with other tools and frameworks.

4. Can data be deleted from a key-value store?
Answer: Yes, data can be deleted from a key-value store. Most key-value stores offer functionality for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting data.

5. How does data replication work in a key-value store?
Answer: Data replication in a key-value store involves making multiple copies of the data in order to ensure availability and reliability. Each copy of the data is stored on a different server, and changes to the data are automatically propagated to all copies in a consistent manner.
