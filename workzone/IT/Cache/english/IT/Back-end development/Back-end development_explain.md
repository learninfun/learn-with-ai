Back-end development refers to the part of software development that focuses on the server-side logic of an application, which can include databases, application programming interfaces (APIs), and servers. Back-end developers are responsible for handling the behind-the-scenes tasks of an application, such as data management and processing.

An example of back-end development is creating a web application that requires user authentication. The back-end developer would create a database to store user information, write scripts for validation and authentication, and build an API that interacts with the front-end of the application. Another example of back-end development is developing the server-side code for an e-commerce application, which would involve creating a database to store product and customer information, building an API to handle payment processing, and creating server-side algorithms for inventory management and order processing.
