1. What is a microservice architecture, and how does it differ from a monolithic architecture?

Answer: A microservice architecture is a software development approach where a large application is decomposed into smaller, loosely-coupled services that can be developed, deployed and scaled independently. Unlike monolithic architectures, which use a single codebase and database, microservices communicate with each other over a network using APIs.

2. What are some advantages of using a microservice architecture?

Answer: Some advantages of using a microservice architecture include improved scalability and flexibility, as well as faster time-to-market for new features. Since each microservice is individually deployable, developers can make changes to specific services without affecting the entire application. This makes it easier to maintain and update the system over time.

3. What is the role of an API gateway in microservice architecture?

Answer: An API gateway serves as the entry point for incoming requests to a microservices-based system. It handles tasks such as routing requests to the appropriate service, enforcing security policies and rate limits, and aggregating data from multiple services in response to a single request.

4. How do microservices handle data persistence?

Answer: Microservices typically use a database per service approach, where each service manages its own data using a dedicated database instance. This allows services to operate independetly and provides better scalability and fault tolerance than a shared database approach.

5. What are some common challenges of working with a microservice architecture, and how can they be addressed?

Answer: Some common challenges of working with a microservice architecture include complexity in managing service interactions, ensuring data consistency across multiple services, and maintaining the correct service dependencies. These challenges can be addressed through thoughtful service design, the use of API gateways to manage interactions, and implementing practices like service discovery and circuit breaking to mitigate failures.
