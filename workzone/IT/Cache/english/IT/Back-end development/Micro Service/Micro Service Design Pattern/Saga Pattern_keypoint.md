1. Saga Pattern is a distributed transaction pattern for coordinating transactions in a distributed system.
2. It is a mechanism to ensure that all the transactions are completed successfully or rolled back.
3. A Saga is a series of interconnected transactions with a mechanism to undo the changes made by each transaction.
4. Each transaction is designed to be idempotent so that it can be safely retried if there is a failure.
5. Sagas use compensating transactions to undo the effects of a transaction if it fails.
6. The Saga orchestrator coordinates the sequence of transactions and handles the failures.
7. Sagas can handle long-running transactions that span multiple services and may take days to complete.
8. Sagas do not provide strong consistency guarantees as they may have to deal with inconsistent states.
9. Sagas are suitable for complex business processes that cannot be modeled using simple ACID transactions.
10. Sagas are implemented using messaging systems, and event-driven architectures are well suited for implementing them.
