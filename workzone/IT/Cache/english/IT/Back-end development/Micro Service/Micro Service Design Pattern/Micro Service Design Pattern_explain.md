Microservice design pattern is a software architecture approach that structures applications as a collection of independently deployable, small, and modular services that communicate with each other through APIs. This approach allows developers to create applications faster, reduce dependence between services, and increase scalability and resilience.

One example of microservice design pattern is an e-commerce application. This application can have microservices for user account management, product catalog management, shopping cart management, order management, and payment processing. Each microservice will have its own isolated database, and all communication between these services will happen through APIs. This approach enables developers to work on different services simultaneously, deploy them independently, and scale services based on their usage. Additionally, if one service fails, the overall system won't collapse, as the other services will continue to operate independently.
