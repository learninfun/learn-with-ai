Bulkhead Pattern is a software design pattern that is used to provide resilience and isolation of an application by creating logical partitions or compartments within the application's architecture. The pattern consists of isolating components or services by creating distinct subsets of services based on business capabilities.

For instance, in a microservices architecture, the bulkhead pattern can be applied by segregating the services based on distinct business capabilities (such as payment processing, customer management, etc.). By doing so, if one service fails, it wouldn't affect the other services in other compartments. This way, the application will be scalable, maintainable, and robust.

Another example can be seen in a monolithic application, where you can use the bulkhead pattern to split your application into different components based on their responsibilities (such as the front-end, back-end, API layer, etc.). This way, if one component fails due to a massive load, the other components won't be affected by the failure.

Overall, the bulkhead pattern is an essential pattern to improve the resilience, agility, and scalability of modern software applications.
