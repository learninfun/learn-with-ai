1. Single Responsibility Principle: Each microservice should have only one responsibility, providing a clear separation of concerns.

2. API Gateway: An API gateway acts as a single entry point for all requests, providing a unified interface to external clients.

3. Service Registry: Service registry is used to keep track of all the available microservices in a system.

4. Service Discovery: Service discovery is the process of finding the location and endpoint of the required microservice.

5. Load Balancing: Load balancing is used to distribute requests among multiple instances of a microservice to ensure availability and scalability.

6. Circuit Breaker: Circuit breaker provides fault tolerance by avoiding cascading failures in the system.

7. Event-Driven Architecture: This approach ensures that microservices communicate asynchronously through events, rather than directly.

8. Containerization: Containerization facilitates the deployment and management of microservices using containers.

9. DevOps: Microservice-based applications require a continuous integration and delivery pipeline to ensure smooth deployment and operation.

10. Resilience: Resilience is critical for microservices, ensuring that the system can recover from failures, handle high loads, and remain highly available.
