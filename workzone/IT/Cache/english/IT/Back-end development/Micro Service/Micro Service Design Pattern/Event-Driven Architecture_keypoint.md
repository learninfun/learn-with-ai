Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a distributed computing architecture that focuses on producing, detecting, and reacting to events.

The following are the key points of Event-Driven Architecture:

1. Events: The architecture is centered around events that occur within a system, and the system responds accordingly.

2. Decoupling: The various components in the system are decoupled, allowing different parts of the system to evolve at different rates.

3. Asynchronous communication: EDA systems typically use asynchronous communication between system components to enable scalability and flexibility.

4. Highly scalable: EDA is highly scalable and can handle unpredictable workloads, which makes it ideal for modern applications that need to scale up and down quickly.

5. Event sourcing: The event sourcing pattern is often used in EDA systems, which involve capturing all changes in the system as a series of events.

6. Microservices: EDA is often used in conjunction with microservices architecture, where each microservice is responsible for a specific business capability.

7. Central event bus: EDA systems typically use a central event bus, which is used to deliver events to all interested subscribers in the system.

8. Reactive programming: Reactive programming is often used in EDA systems, which involve using reactive principles to build more responsive and resilient applications.

9. Fault tolerance: EDA systems are usually designed to be fault-tolerant, where they can continue to operate in the event of failure.

10. Data streaming: EDA can be used for streaming data applications, including large-scale data ingestion and real-time analytics.
