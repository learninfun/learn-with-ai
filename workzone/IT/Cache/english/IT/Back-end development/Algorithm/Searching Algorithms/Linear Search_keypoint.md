1. Linear search is a searching algorithm that checks each element of an array in a sequential manner until the desired element is found.
2. It is a simple and easy-to-understand algorithm.
3. The time complexity of linear search is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. 
4. It is suitable for small arrays or unsorted arrays.
5. Linear search can be implemented with or without recursion.
6. Binary search is a faster alternative to linear search for larger arrays and sorted arrays.
