1. Exponential search is a search algorithm used to find a specific element in a sorted, unbounded list or array.
2. It works by finding the range where the target element might be present and then performing a binary search in that range to find the exact location.
3. The range is expanded exponentially with each iteration until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached.
4. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n) in the worst case, where n is the size of the list or array.
5. Exponential search is efficient for searching large lists or arrays, especially when the target element is near the beginning of the list or array.
