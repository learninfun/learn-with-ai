1. Big O notation is a way to measure the performance of an algorithm.
2. It is used to express the worst-case scenario of how much time or space an algorithm requires to solve a problem.
3. The notation is represented using the letter O and a function, such as O(n) or O(n^2).
4. O(1) means that the algorithm takes constant time to solve a problem.
5. O(log n) means that the algorithm's performance increases logarithmically as the input size grows.
6. O(n) means that the algorithm's performance increases linearly as the input size grows.
7. O(n^2) means that the algorithm's performance increases quadratically as the input size grows.
8. The goal of algorithm design is to minimize the growth rate of Big O notation.
9. Big O notation is useful for comparing the efficiency of different algorithms.
10. It is important to choose the right algorithm that balances performance and other factors, such as memory usage and ease of implementation.
