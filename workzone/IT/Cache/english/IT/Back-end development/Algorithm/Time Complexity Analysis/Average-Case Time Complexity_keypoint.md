1. Average-case time complexity refers to the amount of time it takes for an algorithm to complete on average, given a set of inputs.

2. It is based on the probability distribution of the input data, rather than the specific input values.

3. Average-case time complexity is usually measured using the expected value of the number of basic operations performed by an algorithm on a set of inputs.

4. It is useful for estimating how well an algorithm will perform in real-world scenarios, where the input data is not known in advance.

5. Average-case time complexity can vary widely depending on the characteristics of the input data, such as its size, shape, and structure.

6. In general, algorithms with lower average-case time complexity are considered better performers than those with higher complexity.

7. However, it is important to note that average-case time complexity does not guarantee optimal performance in all cases, and algorithms with higher complexity can sometimes outperform those with lower complexity in certain circumstances.
