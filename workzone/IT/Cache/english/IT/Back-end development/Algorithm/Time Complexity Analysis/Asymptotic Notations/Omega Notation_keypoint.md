1. Omega notation is used to describe the best-case time complexity of an algorithm.
2. Omega notation is represented by the omega symbol (Î©).
3. Omega notation expresses the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm.
4. It indicates the minimum number of operations required in the best case scenario. 
5. The time complexity of an algorithm can have both a lower bound (omega) and an upper bound (big O).
