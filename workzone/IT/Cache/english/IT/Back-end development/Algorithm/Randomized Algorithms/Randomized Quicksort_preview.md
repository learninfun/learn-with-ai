1. What is randomized Quicksort and how does it differ from the traditional implementation of Quicksort?

2. How can the partitioning step of randomized Quicksort be implemented to ensure that the running time is O(n log n) with high probability?

3. What is the main advantage of randomized Quicksort over other sorting algorithms?

4. How does the choice of pivot element affect the performance of randomized Quicksort?

5. Can randomized Quicksort be modified to handle duplicate elements in the input array without sacrificing its running time complexity?
