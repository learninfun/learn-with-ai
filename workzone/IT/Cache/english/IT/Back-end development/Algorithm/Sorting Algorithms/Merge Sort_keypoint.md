1. Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that uses the "divide-and-conquer" principle to sort an array of elements.
2. It breaks the array into two halves, recursively sorts them and merges the sorted halves.
3. The recursion ends when the array reaches a size of 1 or 0.
4. The algorithm maintains a temporary array while merging the two halves.
5. It compares the first element of both halves and places the smaller one into the temporary array, then repeats the process until both arrays are fully merged.
6. Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases.
7. It has a space complexity of O(n).
8. Merge Sort is stable, meaning that it maintains the original order of equal elements in the sorted array.
