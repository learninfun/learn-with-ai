1. What is the time complexity of Quick Sort algorithm in the worst case? 
Answer: The worst-case time complexity of Quick Sort algorithm is O(n^2).

2. What is the key concept behind Quick Sort algorithm? 
Answer: The key concept behind Quick Sort algorithm is the partitioning of the input array around a pivot element.

3. What is an optimal choice of pivot element in Quick Sort algorithm? 
Answer: An optimal choice of pivot element in Quick Sort algorithm is the median of the input array.

4. How is stability defined in sorting algorithms, and is Quick Sort stable? 
Answer: Stability in sorting algorithms means that two equal elements in the input array retain their relative ordering in the output array. Quick Sort is not stable.

5. What is the role of recursion in Quick Sort algorithm? 
Answer: Recursion plays a central role in Quick Sort algorithm, as the partitioning process is applied recursively on the two sub-arrays formed by partitioning the input array.
