Q1: What is the time complexity of selection sort?
A1: The time complexity of selection sort is O(n^2) in the worst-case scenario.

Q2: What is the main disadvantage of selection sort?
A2: The main disadvantage of selection sort is its performance when dealing with a large number of items. It can be inefficient and may take a long time to sort large arrays.

Q3: What is the basic idea behind selection sort?
A3: The basic idea behind selection sort is to select the smallest element in an array and place it at the beginning of the array. Then, repeat this process for the remaining elements until the entire array is sorted.

Q4: Can selection sort be used for sorting linked lists?
A4: Yes, selection sort can be used for sorting linked lists. However, it is not as efficient as other sorting algorithms for linked lists, such as merge sort or insertion sort.

Q5: Is selection sort a stable sorting algorithm?
A5: No, selection sort is not a stable sorting algorithm. This means that the relative order of equal elements may change during the sorting process. For example, if two elements have the same value, the one that appears first in the original array may end up after the other one in the sorted array.
