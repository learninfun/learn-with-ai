1. Matrix multiplication is a mathematical operation that involves multiplying two matrices together to produce a third matrix.
2. The resulting matrix will have a number of rows equal to the number of rows in the first matrix, and a number of columns equal to the number of columns in the second matrix.
3. In order for two matrices to be multiplied, the number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix.
4. The operation involves multiplying each element of the first matrix by the corresponding element of the second matrix, and summing the products to give the value of the corresponding element of the resulting matrix.
5. Matrix multiplication is not commutative, meaning that multiplying two matrices in a different order can result in a different resulting matrix.
6. Matrix multiplication is used in a variety of applications, including computer graphics, physics, and optimization algorithms.
