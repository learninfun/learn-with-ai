1) What is Euclid's Algorithm used for?
Answer: Euclid's Algorithm is used to determine the greatest common divisor between two positive integers.

2) How does Euclid's Algorithm work?
Answer: Euclid's Algorithm involves repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number, then taking the remainder and using it as the new smaller number in the next iteration. This process is continued until the remainder is zero, at which point the last non-zero number that was used as a divisor is the greatest common divisor.

3) Can Euclid's Algorithm be used for negative integers?
Answer: No, Euclid's Algorithm only works for positive integers.

4) Is Euclid's Algorithm efficient for very large numbers?
Answer: Yes, Euclid's Algorithm is very efficient for very large numbers because it only involves repeated divisions and remains relatively quick even for very large inputs.

5) Can Euclid's Algorithm be used to find the least common multiple between two numbers?
Answer: No, Euclid's Algorithm only finds the greatest common divisor between two numbers. To find the least common multiple, a different algorithm must be used.
