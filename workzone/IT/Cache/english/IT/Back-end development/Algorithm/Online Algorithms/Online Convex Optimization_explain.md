Online convex optimization (OCO) is a type of optimization problem that arises in decision making under uncertainty and is used in many applications, such as online advertising, recommendation systems, and resource allocation.

In OCO, at each time step, a decision-maker (or learner) chooses an action from a set of possible actions, and receives a reward or cost according to some unknown objective function. The objective of the learner is to minimize the regret, which is defined as the difference between the cumulative reward obtained by the learner and the cumulative reward that would have been obtained by the best action in hindsight.

An example of OCO can be the problem of online advertising. The goal is to determine which ad to show to a user based on his or her behavior and characteristics. The decision-maker can choose from a set of ads, and receives a reward (in terms of clicks or conversions) for each ad shown. The objective is to maximize the total reward obtained over time, while taking into account that the underlying user behavior and preferences may change over time. In this context, the OCO algorithm can learn from the data collected over time and adjust the ad selection accordingly, in order to optimize the long-term performance.
