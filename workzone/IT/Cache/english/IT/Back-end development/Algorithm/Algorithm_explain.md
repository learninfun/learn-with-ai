An algorithm is a set of instructions or rules that a computer or other device follows in order to perform a specific task or solve a problem. It is a series of steps or procedures that are designed to achieve a specific goal.

An example of an algorithm is an instruction set that a computer follows to perform a specific operation, such as sorting a list of numbers in ascending order. The steps of the algorithm might include scanning the list of numbers, comparing each pair of adjacent numbers, and swapping their positions if necessary to ensure that each number is larger than the one that precedes it. This process is repeated until all the numbers are in ascending order.

Another example of an algorithm is a set of procedures for encrypting and decrypting data using a specific cryptographic algorithm. This might include generating a key, applying various operations to the data to transform it, and then applying the same set of operations in reverse order to decrypt it. This algorithm would be designed to ensure that the encrypted data is secure and cannot be easily decoded by unauthorized users.
