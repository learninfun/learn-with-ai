1. Divide and Conquer is a problem-solving strategy used in computer science, mathematics, and engineering.
2. This approach involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.
3. Each sub-problem is solved independently and the solutions are combined to solve the original problem. 
4. This technique is particularly useful for problems that can be reduced to similar sub-problems, such as sorting or searching algorithms.
5. Divide and Conquer reduces the overall complexity of a problem by avoiding the need to deal with the problem as a whole.
6. It can also make problem-solving more efficient by allowing for parallel processing of sub-problems.
7. Divide and Conquer is widely used in computer science and is the basis for many popular algorithms like merge sort, quicksort, and binary search.
