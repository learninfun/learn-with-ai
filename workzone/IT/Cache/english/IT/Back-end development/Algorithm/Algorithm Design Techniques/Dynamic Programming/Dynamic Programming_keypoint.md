1. Dynamic Programming is an optimization technique that solves complex problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems.

2. It is based on the principle of optimal substructure, which means that the optimal solution to a problem is composed of the optimal solutions to its subproblems.

3. Memoization is a common technique used in Dynamic Programming to save the results of subproblems and avoid having to compute them again.

4. Tabulation is another technique used in Dynamic Programming where a table is created to store the results of multiple subproblems.

5. Dynamic Programming involves making decisions at each step based on the current state, and these decisions can affect the optimal solution.

6. The time complexity of Dynamic Programming algorithms can vary, but they are generally faster than naive algorithms that solve problems by brute force.

7. Dynamic Programming can be used to solve a variety of problems, including those in computer science, economics, mathematics, and engineering.

8. Dynamic Programming can be applied to both deterministic and stochastic problems, where the outcomes may not be known with certainty.
