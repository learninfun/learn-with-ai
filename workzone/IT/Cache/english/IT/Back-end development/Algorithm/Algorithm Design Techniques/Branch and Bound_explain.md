Branch and Bound is a systematic method of solving optimization problems. It works by exploring the space of possible solutions, gradually dividing it into smaller and smaller regions, until the global optimum is found. The method uses a tree structure to represent the space of solutions, where each node corresponds to a particular region. The branching part of the method involves partitioning a node into two or more subregions. The bounding part of the method involves calculating an upper or lower bound on the objective function for each subregion, in order to prune parts of the search space that cannot contain the global optimum. 

Example: The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a classic combinatorial optimization problem that can be solved using Branch and Bound. In this problem, we are given a set of cities and distances between them, and the goal is to find the shortest route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. 

Suppose we have four cities: A, B, C, and D, and the distances between them are given by the following table:

|   | A | B | C | D |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| A |   | 5 | 7 | 6 |
| B | 5 |   | 8 | 9 |
| C | 7 | 8 |   | 5 |
| D | 6 | 9 | 5 |   |

We can represent the solution space using a binary tree. Each node in the tree corresponds to a partial solution, where some cities have been visited and some have not. 

The root node corresponds to the empty tour. We then create two child nodes by selecting the first city to visit (A), and partitioning the remaining cities into two subsets (BCD and BDC). We calculate the lower bound on the length of each subset tour using the nearest-neighbor heuristic. We then explore the node with the lower lower bound first. 

We repeat this process for each subsequent node until we reach a complete tour. At each node, we only explore those subregions that have a potential to contain a better solution than the best one found so far. We also prune parts of the tree that cannot possibly contain the global optimum. This greatly reduces the search space and improves the efficiency of the algorithm.
