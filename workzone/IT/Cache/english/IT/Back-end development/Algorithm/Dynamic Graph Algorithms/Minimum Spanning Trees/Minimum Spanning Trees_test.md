1. What is a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)?
Answer: A Minimum Spanning Tree is a tree that connects all the vertices of a graph with the minimum total weight of edges.

2. How can you find a Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph?
Answer: One way to find a Minimum Spanning Tree is by using Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm.

3. If two edges have the same weight in a graph, which one should be chosen in the Minimum Spanning Tree?
Answer: Either one of the two edges can be chosen in the Minimum Spanning Tree, as long as the total weight of the tree is minimized.

4. Can a graph have multiple Minimum Spanning Trees?
Answer: Yes, if there are multiple edges with the same minimum weight, then there can be multiple Minimum Spanning Trees.

5. What is the time complexity of finding a Minimum Spanning Tree using Prim's algorithm?
Answer: The time complexity of Prim's algorithm is O(E log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices in the graph.
