1) What is a dynamic graph algorithm and how is it different from a static graph algorithm?
Answer: A dynamic graph algorithm is an algorithm which can efficiently handle changes to a graph over time, while a static graph algorithm operates only on a fixed input graph.

2) What is the difference between an incremental and decremental dynamic graph algorithm?
Answer: An incremental dynamic graph algorithm can efficiently handle additions of new edges or vertices to a graph, while a decremental algorithm can efficiently handle removal of edges or vertices from a graph.

3) Can a dynamic graph algorithm be used to solve the shortest path problem on a graph?
Answer: Yes, a dynamic graph algorithm like Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to find the shortest path on a changing graph, provided that the algorithm is updated appropriately after each change.

4) What is the role of data structures in dynamic graph algorithms?
Answer: Data structures like heaps, queues, and trees play a critical role in dynamic graph algorithms as they allow the algorithm to efficiently update the graph and compute the desired output.

5) What are some common applications of dynamic graph algorithms?
Answer: Dynamic graph algorithms are widely used in network optimization, social network analysis, and online data processing. Some specific applications include network routing, traffic management, recommendation systems, and dynamic community detection.
