1. A string matching algorithm that uses pre-processing to limit the number of character comparisons required.

2. The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm avoids starting again from the beginning of the search pattern when a match fails.

3. The algorithm uses information derived from previous matches to determine a new starting position for the search pattern.

4. The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm is based on the observation that, in a failed match, we can backtrack the search pattern to a position where some characters match the beginning of the pattern.

5. The algorithm constructs a table of partial match values for the search pattern, which is used to determine the new starting position.

6. The time complexity of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm is O(n+m), where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the search pattern.

7. The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm can be implemented efficiently using dynamic programming techniques.

8. The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm is widely used in text processing and searching applications.
