1. A subsequence is a subset of characters in a given sequence, arranged in the same order as the original sequence.
2. A common subsequence is a subsequence that appears in two or more given sequences.
3. The longest common subsequence (LCS) is the subsequence of greatest length that appears in two or more given sequences.
4. The LCS problem involves finding the LCS of two or more given sequences.
5. The length of the LCS can be computed using dynamic programming, which involves building a matrix and filling it in a bottom-up manner.
6. The LCS matrix is built by comparing the characters of the two sequences and filling in values in the matrix based on whether or not there is a match.
7. The length of the LCS is the value in the bottom-right corner of the LCS matrix.
8. The actual LCS can be found by backtracking through the LCS matrix.
9. The time complexity of the LCS algorithm is O(mn), where m and n are the lengths of the input sequences.
10. The LCS problem has many applications in string manipulation, genetics, and bioinformatics.
