1) What is Brute Force String Matching?
Answer: Brute Force String Matching is a simple algorithmic technique that is used to search for a particular pattern within a larger string by traversing the string sequentially and comparing each character.

2) How does Brute Force String Matching work?
Answer: Brute Force String Matching works by comparing each character of the pattern string to each character of the larger text string until a match is found or the end of the string is reached.

3) What is the time complexity of Brute Force String Matching?
Answer: The time complexity of Brute Force String Matching is O(mn), where m and n are the lengths of the pattern and text strings, respectively.

4) What are some limitations of Brute Force String Matching?
Answer: Brute Force String Matching can be inefficient for larger strings and longer pattern strings. It also does not take advantage of any additional knowledge or structure in the text or pattern.

5) How can Brute Force String Matching be optimized?
Answer: Brute Force String Matching can be optimized by using techniques like the Boyer-Moore algorithm or the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, which take advantage of additional structure in the text and pattern to reduce the number of character comparisons needed.
