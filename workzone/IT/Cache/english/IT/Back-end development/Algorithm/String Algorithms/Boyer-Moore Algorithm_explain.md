The Boyer-Moore algorithm is a pattern-matching algorithm that searches for a pattern in a given string. It relies on two main ideas: the use of a "bad character" rule and a "good suffix" rule to skip unnecessary comparisons.

The "bad character" rule states that if a mismatch occurs at a given position in the pattern, we can shift the pattern to align the last occurrence of that character in the pattern with the mismatched character in the text. This allows us to skip unnecessary comparisons if we know that a certain character cannot be part of the pattern at a given position.

The "good suffix" rule takes advantage of the fact that if a suffix of the pattern matches a substring of the text, we can shift the pattern to align that suffix with that substring, instead of starting from scratch. This helps reduce the number of comparisons needed.

For example, let's say we want to search for the pattern "abc" in the text "abababc". 

1. Start at the end of the pattern and compare it to the last character of the text: "c" matches "c". 
2. Then we move one character to the left in the pattern and compare it to the character immediately to the left of the one we previously compared in the text: "b" does not match "b", so we use the "bad character" rule and shift the pattern to align the last occurrence of "b" in the pattern with the mismatched character in the text. 
3. We can now compare the "a" at position 0 of the pattern with the "a" at position 3 of the text. It matches, so we can move one position to the left in the pattern and repeat step 2.
4. We compare the "b" at position 1 of the pattern with the "b" at position 2 of the text. It matches, so we move one position to the left and repeat step 2.
5. We compare the "a" at position 0 of the pattern with the "a" at position 1 of the text. It matches, so we move one position to the left and repeat step 2.
6. We compare the "a" at position 0 of the pattern with the "a" at position 0 of the text. It matches, and we have found a match of the pattern in the text starting at position 0.

The algorithm use these rules to search the pattern in less than linear time complexity.
