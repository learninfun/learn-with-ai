1. What is the difference between a substring and a subsequence in a string?

A substring of a string is a consecutive set of characters within that string, whilea subsequence is any set of characters (not necessarily consecutive) in the given string that can be arranged in the same order as the original.

2. How can you determine if a string is a palindrome or not?

A palindrome is a string that can be read the same way forwards and backwards. You can determine if a string is a palindrome by comparing the letters from both ends of the string until you reach the middle.

3. What is the longest common subsequence between two strings?

The longest common subsequence between two strings is the longest sequence of characters that appear in both strings (in the same order).

4. What is a suffix array and how is it useful in string algorithms?

A suffix array is a data structure that indexes all suffixes of a given string in lexicographic order. It is useful in string algorithms, as it can be used to efficiently solve a number of string problems such as string matching, longest common prefix and suffix problems, and more.

5. Can you explain the Rabin-Karp algorithm for string matching?

The Rabin-Karp algorithm is a string matching algorithm that works by comparing the hash values of the text and the pattern strings. It uses a rolling hash function to efficiently compute the hash values of substrings of the text and the pattern, and then compares their hash values. If they match, the algorithm checks that the substrings are actually identical, and if so, returns the starting index of the matching substring.
