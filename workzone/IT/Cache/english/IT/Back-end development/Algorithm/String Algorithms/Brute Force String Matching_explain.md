Brute Force String Matching is a simple and straightforward method used to find a pattern or a substring in a given string. In this method, we compare each character in the pattern with each character in the given string one by one, until we find a match or exhaust the entire string. 

For example, let us consider the given string "Hello, World!" and a pattern "World". To find the pattern in the string using Brute Force String Matching, we start by comparing the first character of the pattern 'W' with the first character of the string 'H'. Since they do not match, we move to the next character in the string and compare it with the first character of the pattern again. This process continues until we reach the end of the string or find a matching substring.

In our example, after comparing the 7th character in the string 'W' with the 1st character in the pattern 'W' we realize they match. We then continue to compare the rest of the characters in the pattern with the characters in the given string one by one, and we eventually find a match.

While Brute Force String Matching is simple and intuitive, it can be inefficient when working with large strings, as it can take a lot of time to search through the entire string character by character.
