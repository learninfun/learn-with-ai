1. What is a Trie data structure?
Answer: A Trie data structure is a tree-like data structure that stores and organizes keys (sequences of characters) in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and insertion.

2. How does a Trie differ from a binary search tree?
Answer: While a binary search tree organizes data hierarchically based on values, a Trie organizes data hierarchically based on sequence of characters, such as words or text.

3. What is the time complexity for insertion and search operations in a Trie?
Answer: In a balanced tree, the time complexity for insertion and search is O(log n), while in a Trie, the time complexity for insertion and search is O(k), where k is the length of the key being inserted or searched.

4. How is memory usage optimized in a Trie?
Answer: Memory usage is optimized in a Trie by sharing common suffixes among keys in the tree. This reduces the amount of memory required to store the tree and improves performance.

5. What are some common use cases for a Trie data structure?
Answer: Trie data structures are commonly used for tasks such as autocomplete, spell checking, and IP routing tables. They can also be used in natural language processing and DNA sequencing.
