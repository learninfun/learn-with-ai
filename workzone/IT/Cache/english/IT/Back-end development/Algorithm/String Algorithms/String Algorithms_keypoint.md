1. String algorithms involve manipulating or analyzing strings of character data. 
2. Common tasks in string algorithms include searching for matching substrings, comparing strings for equality, and sorting strings. 
3. String algorithms often require efficient data structures such as tries, suffix trees, or hash tables to handle large datasets. 
4. Popular string algorithms include the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for substring matching, the Boyer-Moore algorithm for string searching, and the Rabin-Karp algorithm for string hashing. 
5. String algorithms are used in a variety of applications, including natural language processing, network packet analysis, and data compression.
