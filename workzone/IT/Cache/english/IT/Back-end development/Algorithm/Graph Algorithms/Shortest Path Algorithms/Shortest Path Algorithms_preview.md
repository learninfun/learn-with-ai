1. What is the definition of a shortest path algorithm and how does it work?
2. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of using Dijkstra’s algorithm compared to other shortest path algorithms?
3. Can you give an example of a real-world application that uses shortest path algorithms?
4. What are some common implementations of shortest path algorithms in computer science?
5. How is the Bellman-Ford algorithm different from Dijkstra’s algorithm, and when should it be used instead?
