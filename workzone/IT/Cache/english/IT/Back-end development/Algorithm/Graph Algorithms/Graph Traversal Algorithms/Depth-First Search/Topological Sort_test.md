1. What is a Topological Sort?
Answer: Topological Sort is a linear ordering algorithm that arranges vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in such a way that each vertex appears before all its successors.

2. What is the time complexity of Topological Sort?
Answer: The time complexity of Topological Sort is O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

3. Can a graph with cycles be topologically sorted?
Answer: No, a graph with cycles cannot be topologically sorted as the algorithm requires the input graph to be a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

4. What is the significance of Topological Sort in computer science?
Answer: Topological Sort is used in various computer science algorithms and applications, including scheduling processes, dependency management, resolving symbol dependencies, and circuit design.

5. What is the difference between Topological Sort and Depth First Search (DFS)?
Answer: DFS is a traversal algorithm that visits all reachable vertices, while Topological Sort is a linear ordering algorithm that arranges vertices in a directed acyclic graph in a specific order. However, both algorithms use similar techniques for graph traversal, and Topological Sort can be implemented using a modified DFS algorithm.
