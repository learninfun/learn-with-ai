A minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm is a technique used in computer science, operations research, and other fields to find the tree that connects all nodes in a graph with the minimum possible cost. In a MST, the sum of the edge weights is minimized, and there are no cycles. There are many MST algorithms, including Prim's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm, and Boruvka's Algorithm. 

Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that starts with a random node and iteratively adds edges to the tree based on their weight. At each step, the algorithm picks the edge with the lowest weight that connects a new node to the tree. This process is repeated until all nodes are included in the tree. 

For example, consider the following graph:

```
     2
 A-------B
 |       |
4|       |3 
 |       |
 C-------D
     1
```

Applying Prim's Algorithm starting from node A, we choose the edge AB of weight 2. Then we can choose CA of weight 4 and CD of weight 3. We now have a minimum spanning tree of weight 9:

```
      2
 A-------B
         |
         |
         |
 C-------D
     1
```
