Depth-First Search (DFS) is a search algorithm that recursively explores the interconnected vertices of a graph in a depth-first manner. The algorithm follows a single branch until the end is reached, and then backtracks to previous vertices if necessary to explore other branches.

To implement DFS, a stack data structure is typically used to keep track of vertices being explored. The algorithm starts at a designated start vertex and pushes it onto the stack. Then, it visits the first adjacent vertex that has not yet been visited and pushes it onto the stack. The algorithm continues with this process, visiting the first adjacent vertex of the last vertex added to the stack until it reaches a vertex with no adjacent unvisited vertices. The algorithm then pops this vertex off the stack and starts exploring the previous vertex.

An example of DFS is the following: 

Consider a graph with vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F, and edges connecting them as follows:

A - B
|   |
C - D - E
    |
    F

Starting from vertex A, DFS would visit vertex B since it is the first adjacent vertex of A. It would then visit vertex D since it is the first adjacent vertex of B that has not yet been visited. From D, DFS would visit E since it is the first adjacent vertex of D that has not yet been visited. Since E has no unvisited adjacent vertices, DFS would backtrack to D and then visit F, which is the only unvisited adjacent vertex of D. Finally, DFS would backtrack to A and then visit vertex C, which is the only unvisited adjacent vertex. The output of the DFS traversal would be: A, B, D, E, F, C.
