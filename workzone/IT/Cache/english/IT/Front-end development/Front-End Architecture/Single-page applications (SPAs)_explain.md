Single-page applications (SPAs) are web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app instead of loading multiple pages. This is achieved using JavaScript to dynamically update the content of the page without refreshing the page.

Example of SPA: Gmail is a classic example of Single-page applications. Once you sign in, you donâ€™t have to go through pages to view your entire email; Gmail dynamically updates and loads the new mail without any page reload. Other examples include Facebook, Google Maps, and Trello.
