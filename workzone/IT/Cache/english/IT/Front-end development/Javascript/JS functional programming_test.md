1. What is the difference between a pure function and an impure function in JS functional programming?
Answer: A pure function always returns the same output given the same inputs and does not have any side effects, while an impure function may have side effects and may not always return the same output given the same inputs.

2. What is a closure in JS functional programming?
Answer: A closure is a function that "closes over" variables from its outer lexical scope, allowing those variables to be accessed and modified even after the outer function has returned.

3. How can you compose multiple functions together in JS functional programming?
Answer: You can use the `compose` or `pipe` functions to combine multiple functions into a single function that applies them in a specific order.

4. What is currying in JS functional programming?
Answer: Currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that each take a single argument. This can be useful for function composition and creating reusable partial functions.

5. What is the purpose of the `reduce` function in JS functional programming?
Answer: The `reduce` function allows you to iterate over an array and accumulate a value by applying a function to each element and the previous accumulated value. This can be useful for performing complex transformations on arrays or calculating aggregate values.
