1. What is a closure in JavaScript?
Answer: A closure is a function that has access to the variables and parameters of its outer function, even after the outer function's execution has completed.

2. Why are closures important in JavaScript programming?
Answer: Closures are important because they allow functions to maintain their state, even after they have finished their execution. This makes it possible to write more efficient and reusable code.

3. How does a closure differ from a regular function in JavaScript?
Answer: A closure is a function that has access to the variables and parameters of its outer function, while a regular function does not. A closure also has the ability to remember and access its own variables after its parent function has completed execution.

4. How do you create a closure in JavaScript?
Answer: A closure is created by defining a nested function inside another function, and then returning that nested function to the outer scope.

5. What is the scope chain in JavaScript?
Answer: The scope chain is a hierarchy of scopes that determine which variables and functions are accessible within a given block of code. Each function has its own scope, and the scope chain determines which scopes are accessible to a given function at any given time. Closures use the scope chain to access their parent functions' variables and parameters.
