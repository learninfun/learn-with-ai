Color contrast refers to the difference in hue, tone, and saturation between two or more colors, which affects the visual clarity and legibility of content. High contrast between colors makes content more readable and accessible, whereas low contrast can cause eye strain, confusion, and difficulty in distinguishing elements.

One example of color contrast is black and white. These colors have a high contrast due to their opposing tones and can make text and images pop off the page. Another example of color contrast is yellow and blue, which have different hues and saturation levels that create a clear contrast, making it easier to distinguish between them. In web design, designers often use high contrast colors to draw attention to critical information and make it more accessible to users.
