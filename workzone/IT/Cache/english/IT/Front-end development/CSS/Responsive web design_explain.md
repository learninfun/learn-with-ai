Responsive web design is an approach to web design that makes websites adapt to different screen sizes and devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers. With responsive design, the layout and content of a website will adjust automatically to fit the screen size of the user's device, making it easier to read and navigate.

For example, let's say you visit a website that uses responsive design on your desktop computer. The website might have a full-width header, a navigation menu across the top, and three columns of content. When you access the same website on your mobile phone, the layout of the website will adjust so that the header is smaller, the navigation menu becomes a drop-down menu, and the three columns of content become a single column that you can scroll through.

Another example is if you're browsing a retail website on your desktop and add items to your cart, but then later decide to finish your purchase on your mobile device. With a responsive design, the shopping cart and checkout process would be streamlined to fit the smaller screen of your mobile device, making it easier to complete your purchase on the go.
