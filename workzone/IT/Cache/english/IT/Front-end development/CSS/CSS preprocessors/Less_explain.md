Less is a CSS preprocessor that extends the functionality of CSS and makes it more modular, efficient, and easy to maintain. It adds features like variables, mixins, functions, and nesting, which enable users to write code in a more organized and reusable way. Less code is taken as input and converted into standard CSS, which then can be used in web development.

Example:

Let's say we have to define the same color in multiple places in a CSS file. With CSS, we have to write the color value every time it needs to be used. But with Less, we can define the color as a variable and use it multiple times:

```
/* CSS Example */
.main-nav {
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: #ffffff;
}
.btn-primary {
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: #ffffff;
}
```

```
// Less Example
@primary-color: #007bff;
.main-nav {
  background-color: @primary-color;
  color: #ffffff;
}
.btn-primary {
  background-color: @primary-color;
  color: #ffffff;
}
```
In the example above, we define the primary color as a variable and use it wherever we want to use the same color code. This makes the code more organized and easier to maintain, especially when we have to make changes to the color value later on.
