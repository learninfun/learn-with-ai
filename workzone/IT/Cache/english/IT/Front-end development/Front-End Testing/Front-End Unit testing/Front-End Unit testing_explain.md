Front-end unit testing is the process of testing and verifying individual components or modules of the user interface of a software application. This testing approach focuses on testing the front-end code to ensure it meets the functional requirements of the user interface, which includes features such as buttons, forms, menus, and navigation.

For example, letâ€™s consider an e-commerce website that allows users to browse, select, and purchase items. Front-end unit testing could involve testing individual components of the website, such as the navigation menu, search bar, and shopping cart. The shopping cart component could be tested by adding products to the cart, modifying quantities, and removing items to ensure that the cart updates correctly.

The goal of front-end unit testing is to identify and fix defects at an early stage of development, reducing the likelihood of bugs in the finished product. This approach helps ensure that the application is reliable, easy to use, and meets the needs of end-users.
