Jest is a popular open-source testing framework for JavaScript that is widely used to test React applications. It is developed and maintained by Facebook and used internally by the company to test React, Instagram, and other products.

Jest is designed to be easy to use and can be configured to work with any JavaScript project. It includes a wide range of features such as built-in mocking, snapshot testing, and code coverage reports.

Example:

Here is an example of Jest code to test a simple function that calculates the sum of two numbers:

```
function sum(a, b) {
   return a + b;
}

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
   expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

In this example, the test() function is used to define a test case. It takes two arguments: a description of the test and a function that contains the test code.

The expect() function is used to make an assertion about the output of the sum() function. In this case, it is checking that the sum of 1 and 2 is equal to 3 using the toBe() matcher. If the test passes, Jest will output a success message. If it fails, Jest will output an error message with details about the failure.
