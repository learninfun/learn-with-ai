Front-End End-to-end testing is a technique used to test the interaction between different components of an application from the user's perspective. It focuses on testing the user interface and functionality of the front-end of an application.

An example of Front-End End-to-end testing can be testing an e-commerce website's checkout process, where the tester checks whether the user can add items to the cart, fill in their billing and shipping information, and successfully complete the payment process. The tester can simulate a real user and test the whole process from start to finish, including error handling and validation checks.

Tools like Cypress, Selenium, and TestCafe can be used to perform Front-End End-to-end testing, and it is considered an essential part of the testing process for any web application.
