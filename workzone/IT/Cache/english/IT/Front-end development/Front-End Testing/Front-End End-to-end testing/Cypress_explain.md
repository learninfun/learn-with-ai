Cypress is an end-to-end testing framework that is used to test modern web applications. It allows developers to write tests in JavaScript and offers features like handling asynchronous web requests, mocking requests, and performing load and performance tests.

An example use case of Cypress testing could be validating the userâ€™s login feature of a web application. This would involve visiting the login page, entering valid and invalid user credentials, and ensuring that the user is either logged in or receives an error message. The Cypress testing framework can automate this entire process and provide detailed logs and reports, enabling developers to quickly identify and resolve any issues.
