Web components are a set of standardized APIs that allow developers to create custom, reusable, and encapsulated HTML tags or components. The main aim of web components is to simplify the process of building complex web applications by providing a way to reuse code in a structured and organized manner.

An example of web components is a custom element for a product gallery. The custom element may consist of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that encapsulate the product gallery UI and behavior. The product gallery element can be used in different parts of the web application, such as the product detail page, homepage, and search results. The benefit of web components is that they provide a mechanism to share and reuse code across different projects, which saves time and improves code quality.
