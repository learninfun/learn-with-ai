Code splitting is a technique used in software development to break up large codebases into smaller, more manageable pieces. It involves splitting a large application into multiple smaller chunks, each of which can be loaded independently when needed. The purpose of code splitting is to reduce the time-to-first-byte (TTFB) and improve the initial load time of an application.

For example, imagine you are building an e-commerce website that includes a shopping cart, product listing page, and checkout page. If you were to load all of these pages at once, your website's performance would suffer, and users would be deterred from using your website. This is where code splitting comes in.

By using code splitting, you can split your code into smaller chunks that only load when needed. This means that when a user accesses your website, they will only need to load the page they are accessing, rather than the entire application.

For instance, when a user navigates to the checkout page, the server will only send the JavaScript code required for that page. This code is loaded instantly, ensuring that the user can start making purchases without any delay. Meanwhile, other parts of the application, such as the product listing page, can continue to load in the background, ensuring that they are ready to go when the user needs them.

Code splitting can also help improve your website's SEO, as search engines can more easily index your pages if they are smaller and load more quickly. By using code splitting, you can help ensure that your website is fast, responsive, and provides a great user experience.
