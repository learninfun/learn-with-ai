Lazy loading is a technique for loading content or images on a webpage only when it's needed or called upon instead of loading everything at once. Essentially, this means that any assets that are not currently visible in the viewport of the user's device are not downloaded or loaded, which ultimately improves page speed and reduces resource consumption.

For example, when you visit a website, and the page has multiple images, normally all these images load at once, and this makes the site slower. But with lazy loading, only the images that are visible in the viewport will load initially, and the rest will only load as the user scrolls down or through the page, thereby providing a much faster and responsive experience.

This technique is particularly useful in web development because it helps to improve the user experience and retention, reduces bandwidth usage and server storage, and speeds up page load times. Lazy loading can be used to improve the performance of anything from images, videos, and even background graphics.
