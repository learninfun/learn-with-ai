2. Linters check code against a predefined set of rules or standards to ensure code consistency and readability, reducing the potential for bugs or issues.
3. Linters can be integrated into code editors or run as standalone tools, and can be customized to enforce specific coding styles or practices.
4. Linters can help identify potential security vulnerabilities or code smells, such as unused variables or functions.
5. Linters can also be used to enforce best practices, such as validating input, using secure coding techniques, and avoiding common coding mistakes.
