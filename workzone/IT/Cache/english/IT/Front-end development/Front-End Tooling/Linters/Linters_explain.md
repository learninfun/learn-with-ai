Linters are programs that analyze source code for potential issues, such as syntax errors, style inconsistencies, and problematic code constructs. They are commonly used in software development to enforce best practices and ensure code quality. Linters can be either standalone tools or integrated into development environments, such as editors or IDEs.

One example of a popular standalone linter is ESLint, which is used for JavaScript code analysis. ESLint can detect a wide range of issues, from undefined variables and unused code to standard formatting violations and problematic coding patterns. It offers a flexible configuration system that allows users to customize the rules and severity levels according to their preferences and project requirements.

Another example of an integrated linter is Pylint, which is a Python code analyzer that runs within IDEs such as PyCharm or VS Code. Pylint checks for common coding errors, such as unused variables, inconsistent indentation, and incorrect method signatures. It also provides suggestions for improving code quality and adherence to best practices.
