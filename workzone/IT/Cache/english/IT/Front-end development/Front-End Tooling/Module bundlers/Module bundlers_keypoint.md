1. Module bundlers are tools that help with organizing and consolidating code written in modules.
2. The major function of module bundlers is to take different modules and combine them into a single file that can be executed in a browser or a server.
3. Common module bundlers include Webpack, Rollup, and Parcel.
4. Module bundlers support a variety of module formats, such as CommonJS, AMD, ES6/ES2015, and more.
5. Bundling can help with performance optimization, as the size of the final code can be minimized by removing unused code or unnecessary dependencies.
6. Module bundlers can also handle tasks such as transpiling code (e.g., to convert ES6 code into ES5) and processing other assets like CSS, images, and fonts.
7. The configuration options of a module bundler can affect output size, build speed, and compatibility with different environments and browsers.
8. Debugging bundled code can be challenging due to the loss of module boundaries and the transformation of variable names.
9. Source maps can be used to trace back the original code and identify issues during development and testing.
10. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines can include module bundlers to automate the build and deploy process of an application.
