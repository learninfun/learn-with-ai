1. Bundling: Webpack is primarily used for bundling JavaScript files into a single file that can be easily loaded by the browser.

2. Configuration: Webpack allows developers to customize its behavior by configuring various settings, such as entry points, output paths, loaders, and plugins.

3. Loaders: Webpack uses loaders to transform files into modules that can be included in the bundle. Loaders can handle a variety of file types, such as CSS, images, and fonts.

4. Plugins: Webpack plugins are used to perform more advanced tasks, such as code optimization, asset management, and injection of dependencies.

5. Code splitting: Webpack enables developers to split the code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand, reducing page load times.

6. Development server: Webpack includes a built-in development server that allows developers to quickly test their code changes without having to manually refresh the page.

7. Hot module replacement: Webpack allows for hot module replacement, which means that code changes can be immediately reflected in the browser without having to refresh the page.

8. Tree shaking: Webpack can optimize the size of the bundle by removing unused code, also known as tree shaking.

9. Integration with other tools: Webpack can be integrated with other tools, such as Babel, TypeScript, and React, to enable a more streamlined development workflow.
