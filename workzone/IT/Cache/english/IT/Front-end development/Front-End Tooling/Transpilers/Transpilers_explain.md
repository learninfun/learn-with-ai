Transpilers are tools that help converts code from one language to another language without changing its functionality. It allows developers to write code in modern languages, and then transpile it into the target language so that it can run on specific runtimes or environments.

For instance, Babel is a popular transpiler used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ to a back-compatible version of JavaScript that can run on older browsers. Babel allows developers to write code using the latest features and syntax of JavaScript ES6 and above, while ensuring the code is compatible with the majority of web browsers.

Another example of a transpiler is TypeScript. It transpiles TypeScript code to JavaScript code. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means that it allows developers to write code with a high-level of abstraction and using additional features such as static typing, interfaces, classes among others, but then transpiles that code into a JavaScript file that can run on any browser.

Overall, transpilers play an essential role in modern software development by allowing developers to use the technologies that they prefer while still ensuring compatibility across a range of platforms and environments.
