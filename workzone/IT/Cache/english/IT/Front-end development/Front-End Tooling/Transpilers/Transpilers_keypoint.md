1. Transpilers are tools that convert code written in one programming language to another language.

2. The most common use of Transpilers is to convert code written in newer versions of a language to older versions. This is often used in web development, where newer versions of JavaScript may not be supported by all browsers.

3. Transpilers are also used to port code between different languages. For example, a Java program may be converted to C# using a Transpiler.

4. Transpiling is not the same as compiling. Compilers take source code and produce executable code, while Transpilers produce source code in a different language.

5. Some popular Transpilers include Babel, TypeScript, and CoffeeScript.

6. Transpilers can improve code quality and maintainability, by allowing developers to use newer language features without sacrificing compatibility with older environments.
