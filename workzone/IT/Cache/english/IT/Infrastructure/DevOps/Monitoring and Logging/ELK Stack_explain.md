The ELK Stack, also known as the Elastic Stack, is a set of open-source tools used for real-time data processing and analysis. The three main components of the ELK Stack are Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.

Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine used to store, search, and analyze the data. Logstash is a server-side data processing pipeline used to collect, parse, and transform the data before it is indexed in Elasticsearch. Kibana is a data visualization platform used to visualize and explore data stored in Elasticsearch.

An example of the ELK Stack in action is in a website monitoring scenario. Logstash can collect logs from web servers, parse and transform them, and send that data to Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch then stores and indexes the data, making it easy to search and visualize it in Kibana. This allows website owners to track website performance, detect issues, and troubleshoot problems in real-time.
