1. Infrastructure as Code: Terraform allows you to write code to provision, manage, and deploy infrastructure in a declarative way. This means you define what you want your infrastructure to look like, and Terraform handles the rest.

2. Multi-Cloud Support: Terraform is cloud-agnostic, allowing you to manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and many others.

3. State Management: With Terraform, you can store the current state of your infrastructure as a file, which allows you to track updates, changes, and dependencies.

4. Resource Graph: Terraform creates a dependency graph of your infrastructure resources, which it uses to determine the order in which to make changes to those resources.

5. Modularity: Terraform allows you to break down your infrastructure into manageable modules, which can be shared and reused across different projects.

6. Automation: Terraform can be fully automated to automatically apply, update, and destroy infrastructure resources as needed.

7. Version Control: Terraform code can be version-controlled, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on infrastructure changes and track those changes over time.

8. Community Support: Terraform has a large and active community of users and contributors, offering support, examples, and best practices.
