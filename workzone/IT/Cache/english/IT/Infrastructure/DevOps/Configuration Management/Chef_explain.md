Chef is an open-source configuration management tool used by developers and IT administrators to automate the installation and configuration of software and infrastructure. It allows for the management of infrastructure as code, enabling users to write code that represents the desired state of their infrastructure, and then have Chef ensure that the configuration of the infrastructure aligns with that code.

An example of how Chef may be used is to automate the installation and configuration of a web server. The Chef code may specify which packages and dependencies are required, configure firewall rules, and ensure that the web server is running and listening on the appropriate port. The Chef code can be tested and version-controlled like traditional software code, and changes can be rolled out to production environments with confidence that the infrastructure will remain in the desired state.
