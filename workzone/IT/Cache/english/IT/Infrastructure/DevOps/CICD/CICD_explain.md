CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery. It is a software engineering approach that ensures that every change made to a codebase is tested, integrated, and deployed automatically to production. This approach seeks to automate the building, testing, and release of software changes.

Here is an example: 

Suppose a development team is working on an e-commerce website. Every change to the websiteâ€™s codebase, such as adding a new feature, fixing a bug, or updating a component, is checked into a version control system, and the system compiles and runs the tests.

After testing, the code changes are automatically deployed to a staging environment for further testing and review by QA. Once QA approves the changes, the code is automatically deployed to production. 

This cycle of integration, testing, and deployment is continuous, meaning that any change made to the codebase is continually integrated into the software and pushed to production as soon as it is deemed stable and safe to do so. The goal of this approach is to improve the speed, reliability, and quality of software delivery.
