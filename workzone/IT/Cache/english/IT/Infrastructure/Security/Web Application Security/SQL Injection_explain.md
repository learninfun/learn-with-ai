SQL injection is a type of cyber attack in which malicious actors exploit vulnerabilities in a database's SQL system to manipulate or inject code that can access or modify sensitive data. In simpler terms, SQL injection involves attackers entering malicious SQL code into a form or field that is meant to receive SQL commands. This malicious code then trickles through the system, granting unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data. 

For example, a common SQL injection attack can occur when a user types in a username and password into a login form. Without proper security measures, an attacker could enter something like " 'or '1'='1" into the username or password field, which can fool the server into allowing them access to all of the credentials or information stored within the database. Furthermore, attackers may exploit SQL injection to perform more elaborate actions, such as manipulating or even deleting the entire database. This highlights the importance of robust security measures that can prevent such attacks.
