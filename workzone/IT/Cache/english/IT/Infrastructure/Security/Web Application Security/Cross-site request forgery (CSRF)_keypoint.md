1. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is a type of cyber attack that tricks a user into performing actions on a web application without their knowledge or consent.

2. The attack works by manipulating a user's web browser to send unauthorized requests to a vulnerable website.

3. The attacker usually achieves this by embedding malicious code in a website, email or pop-up window that the user clicks on.

4. The malicious code includes a request to a target website, which the user's browser automatically sends along with their session cookie â€“ effectively impersonating the user and allowing the attacker to carry out actions on their behalf.

5. CSRF attacks can be used to steal sensitive data, initiate fraudulent transactions, or even take over user accounts.

6. Preventive measures include using multi-factor authentication, securing session tokens and cookies, and implementing anti-CSRF tokens or nonces to verify the legitimacy of requests.
