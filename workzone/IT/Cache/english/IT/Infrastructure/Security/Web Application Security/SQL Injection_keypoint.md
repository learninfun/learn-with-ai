1. SQL Injection is a type of cybersecurity attack that targets web applications that rely on SQL databases for data storage.
2. Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database.
3. SQL Injection can enable attackers to extract sensitive information, modify or delete data in the database, and even take control of the entire application.
4. Web applications that use user inputs to construct SQL queries are most vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.
5. The best way to prevent SQL Injection attacks is to use parameterized queries, prepared statements, or stored procedures instead of constructing SQL queries from user inputs.
6. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing can also help to identify and mitigate SQL Injection risks.
