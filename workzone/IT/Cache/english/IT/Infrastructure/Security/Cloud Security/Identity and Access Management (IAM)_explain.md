Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a security framework that enables an organization to manage and control access to its critical resources, including applications, networks, data, and systems. IAM provides a comprehensive approach to manage digital identities, access privileges, and authentication for users, devices, and applications across the enterprise.

IAM involves the following:

1. Authentication: This process verifies the identity of users who attempt to access an organization's resources. This process can be accomplished through a password, biometric verification, or a Smart Card.

2. Authorization: This process determines what permissions users are granted to access specific resources. This is usually determined by the user's role or job function.

3. Privilege Management: This process enables administrators to assign different levels of privileges to different user groups or individuals.

Example: An organization uses IAM to manage access for its employees to various applications and systems. When a new employee joins the company, the organization creates a digital identity for them and assigns them the appropriate permissions based on their job responsibilities. The employee will then use the assigned credentials to access the company's resources. When the employee leaves the organization, their digital identity is deactivated to prevent unauthorized access. In this example, IAM helps to protect the organization's resources while providing the necessary access to its employees.
