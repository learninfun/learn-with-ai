Security Groups and Network Access Control Lists (ACLs) are two important concepts in controlling the network traffic in AWS.

Security group refers to a virtual firewall that can control incoming and outgoing traffic within an EC2 or any other VPC. It acts as a filter to accept or deny traffic based on its rules. Security groups operate at the instance level, which means they control traffic directly to the instance. A security group evaluates inbound and outbound traffic on all instances within its scope, allowing for better containment of threats.

For instance, consider a company has one EC2 instance running a database service and another web server instance running an application. The company can create two separate security groups, one for the database instance and another for the web server instance. By doing this, the company can ensure that traffic that is directed to a specific service is only allowed in the security group that governs it. Also, because security groups can only allow traffic and not deny it, a specific rule must exist to block traffic.

On the other hand, Network ACLs take control at the subnet level, operating as a virtual filtering layer for outbound and inbound traffic within a particular subnet. Network ACLS can be used to block specific or unsolicited traffic, reduce the exposure and maintain audit trails. Generally, Network ACLs are rule-based security protocols that prevent unwanted traffic based on IP addresses, protocols, subnets, ports or services.

To sum up, Security groups offer an additional layer of protection than ACLs as they can filter the traffic at the instance level, whereas ACLs work on the subnet level. Security groups are stateful, and Network ACLs are stateless. Network ACLs are more suitable for allowing or blocking subnets, and Security groups are suitable for controlling application-level traffic.
