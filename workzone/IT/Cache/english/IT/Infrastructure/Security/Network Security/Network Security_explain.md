Network security refers to the practice of protecting computer networks from unauthorized access, theft, or damage to their hardware, software, and electronic data. It includes technologies, policies, procedures, and best practices designed to protect data and networks from various types of cyber attacks such as malware, viruses, phishing, social engineering, denial-of-service attacks, and other types of security breaches.

For example, one of the primary approaches to network security is to implement firewalls, which act as a barrier between the internal network and untrusted external networks such as the internet. Firewalls examine incoming and outgoing traffic and filter out malicious packets that could cause harm to the network. Additionally, network security can involve the deployment of virtual private networks (VPNs) for secure remote access to enterprise resources, intrusion detection and prevention systems, patch management, data encryption, and regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities and threats. These measures help prevent unauthorized access, data theft, and other cyber threats.
