Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is a process of developing software that integrates security into the software development cycle at every stage. It is a structured process that ensures the development of secure software that conforms to the required security standards, legal requirements, and industry best practices.

The Secure Software Development Lifecycle includes the following phases:

1. Requirement Analysis: Here, the requirements are gathered, analyzed, and defined with a focus on security. Threat modeling is performed to identify potential security risks and vulnerabilities.

2. Design: In this phase, a security design is integrated into the software design process. Security controls and countermeasures are implemented to mitigate identified risks.

3. Implementation: During implementation, the development team uses secure coding practices to ensure the security of the software.

4. Testing: Security testing is performed to ensure that the software is resilient to attacks and vulnerabilities.

5. Deployment: Finally, the software is deployed in a secure environment using secure configuration and management practices.

An example of Secure Software Development Lifecycle in action is the development of an e-commerce website that includes payment processing. The SDLC process would involve identifying and mitigating potential threats to payment processing, such as credit card fraud and data breaches. The development team would implement secure coding practices, perform security testing, and deploy the website in a secure environment with secure configurations. By implementing Secure SDLC, the e-commerce website ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the payment processing system.
