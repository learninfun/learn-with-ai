1. Shifts security responsibility left: DevSecOps emphasizes a more collaborative approach to security, where security is integrated and treated as an integral part of the development process. Responsibility for security is shifted from a centralized security team to everyone involved in the software development process.

2. Continuous security testing: DevSecOps approach involves continuous security testing to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the codebase earlier in the development process. This includes testing and analyzing code during development, testing in staging and production environments, and monitoring in production.

3. Automation: DevSecOps relies on automation to integrate security testing into the development process as early as possible. This includes the use of automated security tools to scan code for vulnerabilities, automate testing, and build security checks into the development and deployment pipelines.

4. Collaboration and communication: DevSecOps encourages collaboration and communication between developers, security teams, and other stakeholders throughout the entire software development lifecycle, from planning to deployment.

5. Compliance and regulation: DevSecOps also emphasizes compliance with regulatory and compliance requirements, such as HIPAA, SOX, and GDPR. It encourages the integration of security and compliance into the development process to ensure that software is compliant and secure.

6. Continual security assessment: DevSecOps also involves continually assessing the security of software throughout its lifecycle, including after deployment, to ensure that it remains secure and compliant with security standards and regulations.
