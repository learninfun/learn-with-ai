Virtualization:
1. Allows multiple operating systems to run on a single machine simultaneously
2. Improves hardware utilization and reduces costs
3. Enables easy migration and deployment of virtual machines
4. Provides isolation and security for each virtual machine
5. Increases flexibility and scalability of an IT infrastructure

Containerization:
1. Allows applications to run in isolated environments known as containers
2. Requires less resources than virtual machines as containers share the host operating system's kernel
3. Improves deployment speed and application portability
4. Makes it easier to manage and maintain applications
5. Provides scalability and flexibility in application development and deployment
