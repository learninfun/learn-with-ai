1) What is a database index, and how does it improve performance?
Answer: A database index is a data structure that improves data retrieval performance by allowing the database to quickly find the location of specific data. By creating an index, a database can perform faster search queries and improve overall performance.

2) What is a RESTful API, and why is it important for back-end development?
Answer: A RESTful API is a web service that uses HTTP requests to access and manipulate data. RESTful APIs are important for back-end development because they allow developers to build scalable and modular systems. By separating the client and server layers, developers can add or update functionality without needing to modify the client-side code.

3) What is authentication, and how does it differ from authorization?
Answer: Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity to determine if they are allowed access to a system. Authorization is the process of determining if a user has the appropriate permissions to access specific resources or perform certain actions. While authentication confirms a user's identity, authorization controls their level of access to the system.

4) What is SQL injection, and how can it be prevented?
Answer: SQL injection is a security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker injects malicious code into a database query. The malicious code can be used to steal data, modify data, or delete data. To prevent SQL injection, developers should use parameterized queries and input validation to ensure that user input is not executed as code.

5) What is caching, and how can it improve performance in a web application?
Answer: Caching is the process of storing data temporarily in memory to improve access time. By caching frequently accessed data, a web application can reduce the amount of time it takes to retrieve data from a database or external resource. This can significantly improve overall performance by reducing the load on the system and reducing the amount of time users wait for data to load.
