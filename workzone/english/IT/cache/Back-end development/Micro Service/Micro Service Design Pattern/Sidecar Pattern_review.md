1. What is Sidecar Pattern?
Answer: Sidecar Pattern is a design pattern in which a service is split into two separate components - a main application and a secondary sidecar application that performs some specific functions.

2. What are the advantages of using Sidecar Pattern?
Answer: The advantages of using Sidecar Pattern include better separation of concerns, improved scalability and fault tolerance, and simplified testing and maintenance.

3. How does the Sidecar Pattern fulfill the microservices architecture?
Answer: The Sidecar Pattern fulfills the microservices architecture by providing a way to create small, independent modules that can be easily scaled, updated, and deployed.

4. What are some commonly used sidecar applications?
Answer: Some commonly used sidecar applications include load balancers, service meshes, proxy servers, cache servers, and monitoring agents.

5. How does the Sidecar Pattern help in managing the complexity of microservices?
Answer: The Sidecar Pattern helps in managing the complexity of microservices by isolating some of the core functionalities of the main service into a separate sidecar application. This helps to keep the main service lean and focused on its core tasks, while offloading the secondary tasks to the sidecar.
