1. What is API Gateway and what is its primary function?
Answer: API Gateway is a service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that acts as a central hub for managing API requests and responses. Its primary function is to enable developers to create, publish, and manage APIs for their applications.

2. How does API Gateway work with Lambda functions?
Answer: API Gateway can be used to trigger AWS Lambda functions, which allows developers to build serverless APIs quickly and easily. When a request is made to an API endpoint, API Gateway invokes the corresponding Lambda function and returns the result to the client.

3. How can API Gateway be used to enforce authentication and authorization?
Answer: API Gateway can be configured to require authentication and authorization before granting access to API endpoints. This can be done by creating API keys or using other mechanisms such as OAuth or custom authorizers.

4. What are the benefits of using API Gateway for application development?
Answer: API Gateway provides several benefits for application development, including improved scalability, security, and flexibility. It also allows developers to easily manage and monitor their APIs, and provides various integration options with other AWS services.

5. How can API Gateway be used to implement caching for API responses?
Answer: API Gateway supports caching of API responses to improve performance and reduce latency. Cache settings can be configured for individual API methods, and API Gateway automatically handles invalidating the cache when needed.
