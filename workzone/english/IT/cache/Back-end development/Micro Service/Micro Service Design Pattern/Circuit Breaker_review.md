1. What is the purpose of a circuit breaker in an electrical system? 

Answer: The purpose of a circuit breaker is to protect the electrical system and devices from damage caused by excess current or short circuits.

2. How does a circuit breaker work? 

Answer: A circuit breaker works by interrupting the flow of electricity when the current exceeds a certain level, preventing damage to the electrical system and devices.

3. What is the difference between a circuit breaker and a fuse? 

Answer: A circuit breaker can be reset after it trips, while a fuse must be replaced once it blows. Additionally, a circuit breaker can trip due to excess current or a short circuit, while a fuse can only blow due to excess current.

4. When should you replace a circuit breaker? 

Answer: A circuit breaker should be replaced if it trips frequently or fails to trip when it should, or if it shows signs of physical damage such as cracks or corrosion.

5. Can a circuit breaker be used as an on/off switch? 

Answer: While a circuit breaker can be used to turn off the power to a specific circuit, it is not designed to be used as an on/off switch and doing so can damage the breaker over time. It is recommended to use a proper on/off switch for this purpose.
