1. What is a saga pattern and how does it relate to microservices architecture?
Answer: A saga pattern is a design pattern for managing long-running transactions within a distributed system. It is particularly useful in microservices architecture because it allows each microservice to have its own local transactional consistency, while still ensuring overall consistency across the entire system.

2. How does a saga pattern handle failure scenarios?
Answer: When a failure occurs in a saga, the pattern uses compensating transactions to undo the effects of the previous steps in the transaction. This allows the system to recover from a failure and continue processing without corrupting the data or violating consistency guarantees.

3. What are some common implementation options for implementing a saga pattern?
Answer: There are several ways to implement a saga pattern, including the choreography-based approach, where each service is responsible for managing its own part of the transaction, and the orchestration-based approach, where a central coordinator manages the sequence of operations across the services.

4. How does a saga pattern handle branching scenarios where different outcomes are possible based on the results of previous steps?
Answer: The saga pattern can use a state machine to model the different possible outcomes of a transaction based on the results of each step. This allows the system to handle complex scenarios where multiple branches are possible.

5. What are some limitations of the saga pattern?
Answer: One limitation of the saga pattern is that it can be complex to implement and difficult to reason about, particularly in large distributed systems. Additionally, the compensating transactions used in the pattern can be expensive and time-consuming to execute, particularly if they involve rolling back a large number of changes.
