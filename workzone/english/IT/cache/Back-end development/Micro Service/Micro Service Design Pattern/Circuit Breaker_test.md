1. What is a circuit breaker and how does it work?
Answer: A circuit breaker is an electrical safety device that automatically interrupts the flow of electricity when there is an overcurrent or short circuit, thereby protecting the electrical system from damage. It works by opening the circuit when the current exceeds a particular limit, thus preventing a dangerous situation.

2. What are the different types of circuit breakers and how do they differ from each other?
Answer: There are four main types of circuit breakers â€“ air, oil, vacuum, and SF6. They differ in terms of the medium they use to extinguish the arc that occurs when the circuit breaks. Air and oil breakers are older types and are being phased out in favor of vacuum and SF6 breakers that are more efficient and environmentally friendly.

3. What is the importance of selecting the right size of circuit breaker for a particular electrical load?
Answer: Selecting the right size of circuit breaker is critical in ensuring the safety of the electrical system and the devices that are connected to it. If the breaker is too small, it will trip frequently, causing inconvenience and potential damage. If it is too large, it may not trip when there is an overload, creating a potentially dangerous situation.

4. How does a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) differ from a regular circuit breaker?
Answer: A GFCI is a special type of circuit breaker that is designed to protect people from electric shock. It detects even tiny imbalances in the electrical current caused by a ground fault, and quickly shuts off the power to prevent harm. A regular circuit breaker, on the other hand, is mainly designed to protect equipment from damage due to overloads or short circuits.

5. What are some common causes of circuit breaker trips, and how can they be prevented?
Answer: Common causes of circuit breaker trips include overloaded circuits, short circuits, ground faults, and electrical arcing. To prevent these, it is important to avoid plugging too many devices into one outlet, fix faulty wiring or appliances, avoid water near electronics, and have the electrical system inspected regularly by a professional.
