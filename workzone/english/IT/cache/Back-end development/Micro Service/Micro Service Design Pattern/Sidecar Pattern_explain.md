Sidecar pattern is a design pattern that is used to enhance or extend the functionality of an existing application by attaching an additional component or service to it. The sidecar component typically runs in a separate container and provides added benefits such as monitoring, logging, caching, or even language runtime support. 

For example, suppose an application is built in one programming language but needs to use some tools or libraries only available in another language. In that case, a sidecar service could be deployed in a separate container, running that specific language runtime, and available through an API. It can then be accessed by the main application to perform specific tasks or to access specific features that were not available before. 

Another example could be deploying a sidecar for logging, where the sidecar component captures all the logs from the application and sends them to a centralized logging service. This way, the main application can focus on its core business logic, and the sidecar component handles the logging, eliminating the need for the application to manage its own logging process.
