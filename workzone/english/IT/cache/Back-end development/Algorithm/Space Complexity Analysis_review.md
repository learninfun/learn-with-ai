1. What is space complexity analysis and how is it different from time complexity analysis?
Answer: Space complexity analysis is concerned with the amount of memory space required by an algorithm or program to execute. It is different from time complexity analysis because time complexity focuses on the amount of time taken by an algorithm or program to execute.

2. What is the typical notation used to represent space complexity analysis?
Answer: The typical notation used to represent space complexity analysis is O(1), O(n), O(n²), and so on. The “O” (pronounced “big O”) signifies the upper bound of the amount of space needed by the algorithm or program.

3. How can you estimate the space complexity of an algorithm or program?
Answer: You can estimate the space complexity of an algorithm or program by analyzing the data structures used, the number of variables and their size, and the amount of memory allocated for each operation.

4. What is the impact of space complexity on the performance of an algorithm or program?
Answer: The space complexity of an algorithm or program can have a significant impact on its performance. If too much memory is used, it can lead to slower execution times or even cause the program to crash. On the other hand, if space usage is optimized, the program can execute faster and be more efficient.

5. What are some common techniques used to reduce the space complexity of an algorithm or program?
Answer: Some common techniques used to reduce space complexity include using dynamic programming, implementing algorithms with a smaller memory footprint, using efficient data structures like hash tables or binary trees, and optimizing memory usage by reusing memory blocks.
