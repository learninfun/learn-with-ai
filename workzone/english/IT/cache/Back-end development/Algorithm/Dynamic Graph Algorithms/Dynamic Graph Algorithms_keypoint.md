1. Dynamic graphs are graphs that can change over time.
2. Dynamic graph algorithms deal with problems related to dynamic graphs.
3. Dynamic graph algorithms are designed to handle changes in the graph structure and update relevant information accordingly.
4. Many traditional graph algorithms can be adapted to work with dynamic graphs.
5. Some common problems in dynamic graph algorithms include maintaining connected components, shortest paths, and minimum spanning trees.
6. Dynamic graph algorithms often make use of heuristics, approximation algorithms, or other techniques to achieve efficient running times.
7. Real-world applications of dynamic graph algorithms include network routing, social network analysis, and computational biology.
8. Research in dynamic graph algorithms is ongoing, with new techniques being developed to handle increasingly complex problems.
