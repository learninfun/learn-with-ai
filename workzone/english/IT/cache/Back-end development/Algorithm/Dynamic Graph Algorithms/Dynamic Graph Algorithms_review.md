1. What is a dynamic graph algorithm?
Answer: A dynamic graph algorithm is a computational method that deals with graphs that change over time, where vertices and/or edges can be added, deleted or modified.

2. What is the difference between a static graph and a dynamic graph?
Answer: A static graph is a graph that remains unchanged over time, while a dynamic graph is a graph that can change its topology.

3. What is the minimum number of edges required in a graph to make it connected?
Answer: For an undirected graph, the minimum number of edges required to make it connected is n-1, where n is the number of vertices. For a directed graph, it depends on the topology of the graph.

4. What is the difference between breadth-first search and depth-first search algorithms?
Answer: In a breadth-first search algorithm, nodes are explored by visiting all nodes at the same level before moving on to the next level, while in a depth-first search algorithm, nodes are explored by visiting as far as possible before backtracking.

5. How can Dijkstra's algorithm be modified to deal with dynamic graphs?
Answer: Dijkstra's algorithm can be modified to deal with dynamic graphs by updating the shortest paths after each change in the graph. This can be done using techniques such as incremental shortest path algorithms or using priority queues to efficiently update the distances.
