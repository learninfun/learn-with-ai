1. Dynamic MST focuses on maintaining the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a graph in real-time, as edges are added or removed.
2. The algorithm should be able to quickly update the MST in response to changes in the underlying graph.
3. Dynamic MST can be used in a variety of settings, including network design, resource allocation, and transportation planning.
4. The key data structures used in dynamic MST algorithms are heaps, priority queues, and disjoint sets.
5. There are several approaches to dynamic MST, including incremental algorithms and fully dynamic algorithms.
6. Incremental algorithms add edges to the MST one at a time, while fully dynamic algorithms allow both edge additions and deletions.
7. Dynamic MST algorithms can be more efficient than recomputing the MST from scratch each time there is a change in the graph.
8. However, dynamic MST algorithms can be more complicated to implement and may require more memory than simpler MST algorithms.
