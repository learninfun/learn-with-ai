1. What is a dynamic MST?
Answer: A dynamic MST refers to a minimum spanning tree that can be modified efficiently in response to changes in the underlying graph.

2. How are dynamic MST algorithms different from static MST algorithms?
Answer: Dynamic MST algorithms are designed to update the MST efficiently when edges are added or removed, whereas static MST algorithms compute the MST from scratch each time the graph changes.

3. What is a key property of a dynamic MST algorithm?
Answer: A key property of a dynamic MST algorithm is that it can update the MST with a low time complexity relative to the number of changes in the graph.

4. What are some applications of dynamic MST algorithms?
Answer: Dynamic MST algorithms can be applied in a variety of settings, such as network optimization, wireless sensor networks, and social network analysis.

5. What are some common dynamic MST algorithms?
Answer: Some common dynamic MST algorithms include the incremental and decremental algorithms, the dynamic programming algorithm, and the lazy propagation algorithm.
