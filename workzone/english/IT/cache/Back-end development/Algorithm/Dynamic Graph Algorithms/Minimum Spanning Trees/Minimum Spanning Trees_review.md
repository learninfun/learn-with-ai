1. What is a Minimum Spanning Tree?
Answer: A Minimum Spanning Tree is a tree that spans all the vertices of a graph with the minimum possible total edge weight.

2. How is a Minimum Spanning Tree problem solved?
Answer: A Minimum Spanning Tree problem can be solved using algorithms such as Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm.

3. Can a graph have more than one Minimum Spanning Tree?
Answer: Yes, a graph can have multiple Minimum Spanning Trees if there are multiple sets of edges with the same minimum total weight.

4. Why is finding a Minimum Spanning Tree useful?
Answer: Finding a Minimum Spanning Tree can be useful in optimizing network designs and minimizing costs in communication or transportation networks.

5. What is the time complexity of Kruskal's algorithm for finding a Minimum Spanning Tree?
Answer: The time complexity of Kruskal's algorithm for finding a Minimum Spanning Tree is O(E log E), where E is the number of edges in the graph.
