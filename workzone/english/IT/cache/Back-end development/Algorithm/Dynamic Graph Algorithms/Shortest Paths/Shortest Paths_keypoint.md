- Shortest paths refer to the shortest distances between vertices in a graph.
- The distance between two vertices is the sum of the weights of the edges on the path connecting them.
- Shortest paths can be found using algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm, and Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
- Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that iteratively selects the vertex with the lowest distance from the source and updates the distances of its neighbors.
- Bellman-Ford algorithm can handle negative edge weights and detects negative cycles but has a time complexity of O(VE).
- Floyd-Warshall algorithm computes the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in O(V^3) time.
- The use of priority queues can improve the efficiency of shortest path algorithms.
