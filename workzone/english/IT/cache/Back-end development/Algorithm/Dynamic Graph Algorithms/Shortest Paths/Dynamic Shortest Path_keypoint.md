1. Dynamic Shortest Path is a computational algorithm that calculates the shortest distance between two nodes in a graph in real-time, while the graph is being modified.

2. The algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes, with the node at the front having the shortest distance. 

3. When a node is modified, its neighbors are updated, and the distances to other nodes can change. The algorithm ensures that these changes are propagated efficiently, without recomputing the entire graph.

4. The key advantage of Dynamic Shortest Path is its ability to handle dynamic graphs, where edges or nodes are added, removed, or updated during the computation. 

5. The algorithm is widely used in traffic planning, network optimization, and other real-time applications, where changes in the graph must be rapidly reflected in the shortest path calculations. 

6. A variation of the Dynamic Shortest Path algorithm is the A* algorithm, which uses heuristics to focus the search on the most promising nodes. 

7. Despite its usefulness, Dynamic Shortest Path can be computationally expensive and complex to implement, and therefore may not be suitable for simpler applications.
