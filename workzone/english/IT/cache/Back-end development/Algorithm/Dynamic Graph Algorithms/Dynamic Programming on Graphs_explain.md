Dynamic programming on graphs is a technique to solve optimization problems on graphs by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and solving them recursively. It involves storing and reusing intermediate solutions to subproblems to reduce the running time of the algorithm.

An example of dynamic programming on graphs is the shortest path algorithm. The basic idea is to calculate the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in the graph by gradually considering longer and longer paths.

The algorithm uses a table to store the computed distances to each vertex. At each step, it considers all edges that leave the vertices whose distance has just been updated and computes the distance to the adjacent vertices. By doing so, it can ensure that the shortest paths to a vertex are updated with each step.

This process is repeated until all the distances from the source vertex to all other vertices have been computed. In other words, we iterate through all vertices in the graph to build the shortest path table.

An advantage of dynamic programming on graphs is that it can be used to solve problems that cannot be solved by brute force. It also reduces the running time of the algorithm by avoiding redundant computations.
