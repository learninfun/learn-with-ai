1. What is Euclid's Algorithm?
Answer: Euclid's Algorithm is a simple and efficient method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.

2. How does Euclid's Algorithm work?
Answer: Euclid's Algorithm works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller of two numbers from the larger until both numbers are equal, at which point the common divisor has been found.

3. What is the time complexity of Euclid's Algorithm?
Answer: The time complexity of Euclid's Algorithm is O(log n), where n is the larger of the two numbers being considered.

4. Can Euclid's Algorithm be used to find the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers?
Answer: No, Euclid's Algorithm does not directly find the LCM of two integers, but it can be used in combination with other methods to find the LCM.

5. Why is Euclid's Algorithm important in cryptography?
Answer: Euclid's Algorithm is used in some encryption algorithms, such as RSA, because it allows for efficient computation of the GCD of large integers, a key step in the encryption and decryption process.
