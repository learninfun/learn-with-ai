1. What is the result of multiplying a 2x3 matrix by a 3x2 matrix?
Answer: The resulting matrix is a 2x2 matrix.

2. What is the dot product of the second row of a 3x3 matrix and the third column of a 3x3 matrix?
Answer: The dot product is the sum of the products of the corresponding entries, so it would be the product of the second entry in the second row and the third entry in the third column, plus the product of the second and third entries in the second row and column, plus the product of the second entry in the third row and the third entry in the second column.

3. Can you multiply any two matrices together?
Answer: No, two matrices can only be multiplied together if the number of columns of the first matrix is equal to the number of rows of the second matrix.

4. What is the inverse of a matrix?
Answer: The inverse of a matrix is a matrix that, when multiplied by the original matrix, results in the identity matrix. Not all matrices have an inverse.

5. How do you find the determinant of a 3x3 matrix?
Answer: The determinant of a 3x3 matrix is found by taking the sum of the products of the elements on the main diagonal (i.e. the top left to bottom right diagonal) minus the sum of the products of the elements on the other diagonal (i.e. the top right to bottom left diagonal).
