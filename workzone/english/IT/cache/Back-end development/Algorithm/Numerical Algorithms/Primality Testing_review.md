1) What is the smallest known Carmichael number, and how does it affect primality testing algorithms? 
Answer: The smallest known Carmichael number is 561, and it causes some primality testing algorithms (such as Fermat's little theorem) to mistakenly identify it as prime.

2) What is the Miller-Rabin primality test, and how does it work? 
Answer: The Miller-Rabin primality test is a probabilistic algorithm that tests whether a number is prime. It works by repeatedly choosing random numbers and checking whether they satisfy certain conditions that are only true for prime numbers.

3) What is the AKS (Agrawal-Kayal-Saxena) primality test, and how does it differ from other primality testing algorithms? 
Answer: The AKS primality test is a deterministic algorithm that can determine whether a number is prime or composite in polynomial time. This makes it much faster than some other algorithms, which may require exponential time in worst-case scenarios.

4) How can the Lucas-Lehmer test be used to test whether a number is Mersenne prime? 
Answer: The Lucas-Lehmer test is a primality test specifically designed for Mersenne numbers (numbers of the form 2^n - 1). It works by iteratively computing a sequence of values using a specific formula, and then checking whether the final value is equal to 0, which indicates that the Mersenne number is prime.

5) How does the Baillie-PSW primality test combine probabilistic and deterministic algorithms to improve accuracy? 
Answer: The Baillie-PSW primality test combines the Miller-Rabin probabilistic test with a deterministic algorithm called the Lucas test. By using both algorithms together, it can accurately identify whether a number is prime or composite with a much higher degree of confidence than either algorithm could achieve alone.
