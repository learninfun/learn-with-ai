1. What is the Newton-Raphson algorithm used for?
Answer: The Newton-Raphson algorithm is used to find the roots of a non-linear equation.

2. What is the time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm?
Answer: The time complexity of the QuickSort algorithm is O(nlogn) on average and O(n^2) in the worst case.

3. What is the Gaussian elimination method used for?
Answer: The Gaussian elimination method is used to solve a system of linear equations.

4. What is the difference between interpolation and extrapolation?
Answer: Interpolation is the process of estimating values within a range of known data points, while extrapolation is the process of estimating values beyond that range.

5. What is the purpose of numerical differentiation?
Answer: Numerical differentiation is used to approximate the derivative of a function at a particular point, when an exact analytical formula for the derivative is unavailable or difficult to compute.
