The Miller-Rabin algorithm is a probabilistic algorithm that tests whether a given number is a prime number or not. It works on the concept of Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if p is a prime number and a is any positive integer less than p, then a raised to the power of (p-1) is congruent to 1 modulo p.

The Miller-Rabin algorithm takes advantage of this theorem and randomly selects a number a between 2 and n-2, where n is the number being tested for primality. It then checks whether a raised to the power of (n-1) is congruent to 1 modulo n. If it is, there's a possibility that n is a prime number, and the algorithm proceeds to the next stage. If it's not, then n is definitely not a prime number.

The algorithm then divides (n-1) by 2, repeatedly until it gets an odd number and checks whether the number obtained at each step is congruent to plus or minus 1 modulo n. If all of the numbers obtained are congruent to plus or minus 1 modulo n, then there's a high probability that n is a prime number. If not, then n is definitely not a prime number.

For example, let's test whether 37 is a prime number or not using the Miller-Rabin algorithm. First, we randomly choose a number a between 2 and 35. Let's choose a=5. We then check whether 5^(36) is congruent to 1 modulo 37. Using modular exponentiation, we get 5^(36) = 1 (mod 37). So, there's a possibility that 37 is a prime number.

Next, we divide 36 by 2 repeatedly until we get an odd number: 36/2=18; 18/2=9. We then check whether 5^(9) is congruent to plus or minus 1 modulo 37. Using modular exponentiation, we get 5^(9) = -1 (mod 37). Therefore, 37 is not a prime number.

In conclusion, the Miller-Rabin algorithm is an efficient and reliable probabilistic algorithm for testing primality. It's widely used in cryptographic applications, such as generating keys for RSA encryption.
