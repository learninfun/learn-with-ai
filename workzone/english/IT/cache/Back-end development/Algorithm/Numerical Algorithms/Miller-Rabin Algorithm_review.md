1. What is the worst-case time complexity of the Miller-Rabin algorithm, in terms of the number of iterations required to achieve a desired level of accuracy?

Answer: The worst-case time complexity of the Miller-Rabin algorithm is O(k log n), where k is the number of iterations required to achieve the desired level of accuracy, and n is the number being tested. 

2. What is the main advantage of the Miller-Rabin algorithm over other primality-testing algorithms?

Answer: The main advantage of the Miller-Rabin algorithm is that it is an efficient probabilistic algorithm that can determine primality with a high degree of accuracy, even for very large numbers. 

3. Can the Miller-Rabin algorithm produce false positives (i.e., identify a composite number as prime)?

Answer: Yes, the Miller-Rabin algorithm can produce false positives, although the probability of this occurring can be reduced by increasing the number of iterations performed. 

4. How does the Miller-Rabin algorithm differ from deterministic primality testing algorithms, such as the AKS algorithm?

Answer: The Miller-Rabin algorithm is a probabilistic algorithm that can produce false positives, while deterministic primality testing algorithms always produce correct results (although they may be slower). 

5. Can the Miller-Rabin algorithm be used to generate large prime numbers (i.e., for use in cryptography)?

Answer: Yes, the Miller-Rabin algorithm can be used to generate large prime numbers, but typically it would be combined with other algorithms and techniques to ensure a high degree of accuracy and security.
