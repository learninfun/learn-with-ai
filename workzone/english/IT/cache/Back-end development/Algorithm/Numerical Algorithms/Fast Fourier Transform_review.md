1) What is the primary advantage of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) over the traditional Fourier Transform?
Answer: The FFT algorithm reduces the computational complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n), allowing for faster execution time on large datasets.

2) What is the general procedure for calculating the FFT of a signal?
Answer: The signal is first divided into smaller segments, then each segment is windowed and transformed using the FFT algorithm. The resulting spectra are averaged across all segments to produce the final FFT.

3) What is the Nyquist frequency, and why is it important when performing FFT?
Answer: The Nyquist frequency is the highest frequency that can be accurately represented in a sampled signal. It is important to ensure that the sampling rate is at least twice the highest frequency of interest to avoid aliasing, which can introduce false peaks in the FFT.

4) What is the difference between a real and a complex FFT, and when would you choose one over the other?
Answer: A real FFT only calculates the positive frequencies of a real signal, while a complex FFT calculates both positive and negative frequencies. Real FFTs are faster and require less memory, but they cannot be used with complex signals.

5) How can the FFT be used to enhance signal processing in various applications?
Answer: The FFT can be used to remove noise, identify periodicities, extract features, and classify signals in various fields such as communications, image processing, and biomedical engineering.
