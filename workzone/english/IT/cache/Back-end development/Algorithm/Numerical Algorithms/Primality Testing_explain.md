Primality Testing is a process to determine if a given number is a prime number or not. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

One example of a primality testing method is the trial division method. In this method, we divide the number to be tested by all integers from 2 to the square root of that number. If any divisor other than 1 and itself is found, then the number is composite, otherwise, it is prime.

For example, let's test the number 23 for primality using the trial division method. The square root of 23 is approximately 4.8. We divide 23 by all integers from 2 to 4. We find that there is no divisor other than 1 and 23. Therefore, 23 is a prime number.
