1. What is the framework used to analyze the performance of randomized algorithms?
Answer: Probability theory.

2. What is the expected value of the number of edges in a randomly generated graph with n vertices?
Answer: The expected value is approximately (n^2)/2.

3. What is the most common way to derandomize a randomized algorithm?
Answer: Using a pseudorandom generator.

4. What is the running time of the randomized primality testing algorithm known as the Miller-Rabin algorithm?
Answer: The running time is O(k log^3 n), where k is the number of iterations and n is the number being tested.

5. What is the significance of the Chernoff bound in the analysis of randomized algorithms?
Answer: The Chernoff bound provides a powerful tool for bounding the probability of large deviations from the expected value in a random process.
