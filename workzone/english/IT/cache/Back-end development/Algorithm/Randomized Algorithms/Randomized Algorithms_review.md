1. What is the primary advantage of using a randomized algorithm over a deterministic algorithm?
Answer: Randomized algorithms are often able to solve problems faster or use fewer resources than deterministic algorithms.

2. What is the expected running time of a randomized algorithm?
Answer: The expected running time of a randomized algorithm is the average running time over all possible inputs.

3. What is the difference between a Las Vegas algorithm and a Monte Carlo algorithm?
Answer: A Las Vegas algorithm always produces the correct answer, but its running time may vary. A Monte Carlo algorithm always produces an answer, but its answer may be incorrect with a certain probability.

4. What is the significance of the term "expected" in the term "expected running time" of a randomized algorithm?
Answer: The expected running time is a probabilistic measure of the running time, taking into account the probability of different outcomes for the algorithm for a given input.

5. Can a randomized algorithm be made completely deterministic?
Answer: Yes, a randomized algorithm can be made deterministic, but this often involves adding more computational steps to the algorithm, which may increase its running time or resource usage.
