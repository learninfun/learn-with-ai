1. Randomized Algorithms are used to solve problems by introducing randomness into the algorithms.

2. They obtain solutions in less time or less space than deterministic algorithms.

3. Randomized Algorithms are used to make approximations or to solve problems with a high degree of uncertainty.

4. They make use of probability theory to achieve their desired outcomes.

5. They are used in a broad range of applications, such as cryptography, distributed computing, optimization, and machine learning.

6. Randomized Algorithms are classified into two categories: Las Vegas and Monte Carlo.

7. Las Vegas algorithms always produce the correct output, but the running time is uncertain.

8. Monte Carlo algorithms have a fixed running time, but the output may be incorrect with a certain probability.

9. They are often used in complex problems where deterministic methods cannot achieve desirable results.

10. Randomized Algorithms have revolutionized many fields of computer science, especially in the areas of algorithms, data structures, and parallel computing.
