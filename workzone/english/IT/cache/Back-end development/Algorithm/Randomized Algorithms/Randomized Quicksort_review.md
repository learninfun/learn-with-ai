1. What is the expected number of comparisons made by Randomized Quicksort to sort an array of n elements?
   Answer: The expected number of comparisons is O(n log n).

2. What is the worst-case time complexity of Randomized Quicksort?
   Answer: The worst-case time complexity of Randomized Quicksort is O(n^2).

3. How does Randomized Quicksort differ from traditional Quicksort?
   Answer: Randomized Quicksort selects a random element as the pivot, rather than always choosing the first or last element.

4. What is the main advantage of using Randomized Quicksort over traditional Quicksort?
   Answer: Randomized Quicksort has improved worst-case performance due to the random selection of the pivot.

5. How does the choice of pivot affect the performance of Randomized Quicksort?
   Answer: The choice of pivot can significantly affect the efficiency of Randomized Quicksort, with a bad choice of pivot leading to degraded performance. However, the random selection of the pivot helps to mitigate this risk.
