1. What is the time complexity of Linear Search on an array of size n?
Answer: The time complexity of Linear Search is O(n) in the worst case because it has to check each element in the array starting from the first element until it finds the target value or reaches the end of the array.

2. What is the best case scenario for Linear Search and what is its time complexity in that case?
Answer: The best case scenario for Linear Search is when the target element is found at the beginning of the array. In this case, the time complexity is O(1) because only one comparison is needed.

3. Can Linear Search be used on a sorted array? If yes, what is the benefit of doing so?
Answer: Yes, Linear Search can be used on a sorted array. The benefit of using Linear Search on a sorted array is that if the target element is not found, the algorithm can stop searching as soon as it reaches an element greater than the target element. This can save time in some cases.

4. What is the worst case space complexity of Linear Search?
Answer: The worst case space complexity of Linear Search is O(1) because no additional space is needed beyond the input array and a few local variables.

5. Is Linear Search considered an efficient search algorithm? Why or why not?
Answer: Linear Search is not considered an efficient search algorithm for large arrays because its time complexity grows linearly with the size of the input. For very large arrays, other search algorithms such as Binary Search or Hashing are more efficient. However, for small arrays or when the target element is near the beginning of the array, Linear Search can be a reasonable choice.
