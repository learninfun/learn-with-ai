1. What is the time complexity of binary search on a sorted array of size n?
Answer: O(log n)

2. What is the minimum number of comparisons required in binary search to find an element in an array of size n?
Answer: log2(n) (rounded up to the nearest integer)

3. How does binary search work on a sorted array?
Answer: Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the array in half and searching the half that contains the target element until it is found or determined to not be in the array.

4. What is the main advantage of using binary search over linear search?
Answer: Binary search has a significantly faster runtime on large, sorted arrays, whereas linear search has a runtime proportional to the size of the array.

5. Can binary search be used on an unsorted array?
Answer: No, binary search can only be used on sorted arrays since it relies on the ability to divide the array in half at each step.
