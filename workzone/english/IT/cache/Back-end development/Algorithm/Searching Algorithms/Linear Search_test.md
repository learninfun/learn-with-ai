1. What is the worst-case time complexity of linear search algorithm?

Answer: The worst-case time complexity of linear search algorithm is O(n), where 'n' is the size of the array.

2. What is linear search algorithm?

Answer: Linear search algorithm is a simple search algorithm that sequentially searches for a target value in an array or list by checking each element one at a time until a match is found.

3. Can linear search algorithm be applied to sorted arrays?

Answer: Yes, linear search algorithm can be applied to sorted arrays, but it is not efficient. In sorted arrays, binary search algorithm is preferred.

4. Can linear search algorithm be applied to linked lists?

Answer: Yes, linear search algorithm can be applied to linked lists, but it requires a different approach as there is no concept of index in linked lists.

5. What are the advantages and limitations of linear search algorithm?

Answer: The advantages of linear search algorithm are that it is simple and easy to implement. The limitations of linear search algorithm are that it is inefficient for large sized arrays and does not take advantage of any pre-existing order in the array.
