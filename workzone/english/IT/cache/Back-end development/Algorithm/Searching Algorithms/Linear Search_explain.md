Linear search is a simple searching algorithm that sequentially checks every element in a list until the desired element is found or the end of the list is reached. 

Example: Suppose we have a list of numbers from 1 to 10 and we want to search for the number 7 in the list. We start at the first element and compare it with the desired element. If it’s not a match, we move on to the next element and continue the process until we find the element we’re looking for. In this case, we would start by checking the first element (1), then the second element (2), and so on until we reach the seventh element, which is the number 7 we were searching for. If the element is not found in the list, we eventually reach the end of the list and return with a “not found” message.
