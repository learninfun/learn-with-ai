1. What is Interpolation Search?
Answer: Interpolation search is a searching algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array by estimating its position based on the values of its neighbors.

2. How does Interpolation Search work?
Answer: Interpolation Search uses a formula to estimate the position of the target value within the sorted array, and then searches for the value within the estimated range.

3. What is the time complexity of Interpolation Search?
Answer: The time complexity of Interpolation Search is O(log log n) in the average case and O(n) in the worst case.

4. What is the best case scenario for Interpolation Search?
Answer: The best case scenario for Interpolation Search occurs when the target value is located at the beginning of the sorted array. In this case, the search only takes one comparison.

5. When is Interpolation Search preferred over other searching algorithms?
Answer: Interpolation Search is preferred over other searching algorithms when the data set is uniformly distributed and there are no large gaps between adjacent values. This is because the formula used in Interpolation Search works better in such scenarios, resulting in faster search times.
