1. What is the primary objective of Branch and Bound algorithm?
Answer: The primary objective of Branch and Bound algorithm is to solve optimization problems by exploring the solution space and optimizing the objective function.

2. What is the difference between Branch and Bound and Brute force approaches?
Answer: Branch and Bound approach reduces the search space by eliminating the suboptimal solutions, while brute force approach searches all the possible solutions without any optimization.

3. Explain the term "bounding" in the context of Branch and Bound algorithm.
Answer: Bounding is the process of estimating the upper and lower bounds of the objective function for a given solution. It helps in eliminating the suboptimal solutions and reducing the search space.

4. How does Branch and Bound algorithm handle constraints in the optimization problem?
Answer: Branch and Bound algorithm incorporates the constraints of the problem by generating feasible solutions and pruning the search space beyond the constraints.

5. What is the complexity of the Branch and Bound algorithm?
Answer: The complexity of Branch and Bound algorithm depends on the size and complexity of the optimization problem. It can range from polynomial to exponential time complexity.
