1. What is a greedy algorithm and how does it work?
Answer: A greedy algorithm is a simple algorithmic strategy that chooses the optimal solution at each step, without consideration for future steps.

2. What is the difference between a greedy algorithm and a dynamic programming algorithm?
Answer: A greedy algorithm makes decisions based on the current best choice, while a dynamic programming algorithm considers the best choice at each sub-problem in order to build the optimal solution.

3. What is the time complexity of a greedy algorithm?
Answer: The time complexity of a greedy algorithm is typically linear or logarithmic, depending on the size of the input data.

4. Can a greedy algorithm always find the optimal solution?
Answer: No, a greedy algorithm may not always find the optimal solution because it makes locally optimal choices that may not lead to a globally optimal solution.

5. What are some common applications of greedy algorithms?
Answer: Some common applications of greedy algorithms include scheduling problems, shortest path algorithms, and optimization problems in computer science and mathematics.
