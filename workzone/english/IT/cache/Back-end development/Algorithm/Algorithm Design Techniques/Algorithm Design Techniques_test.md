1) What is dynamic programming? 
Answer: Dynamic programming is a technique used in algorithm design where a problem is divided into smaller subproblems, and solutions to the subproblems are stored and reused as needed to solve the larger problem. 

2) What is the difference between a greedy algorithm and a dynamic programming algorithm? 
Answer: A greedy algorithm makes the locally optimal choice at each step, without considering the overall solution. Dynamic programming considers all possible solutions and chooses the optimal one. 

3) What is backtracking? 
Answer: Backtracking is an algorithmic technique where solutions are constructed incrementally and can be abandoned if they are found to be invalid. The algorithm starts constructing a solution and backtracks to find another solution if the current one does not work. 

4) What is divide and conquer? 
Answer: Divide and conquer is an algorithmic technique where a problem is divided into smaller subproblems, which are then solved independently, and the solutions are combined to solve the original problem. 

5) What is graph traversal? 
Answer: Graph traversal is the process of visiting and exploring all the nodes of a graph. There are two popular graph traversal algorithms: depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).
