1. What is backtracking? 
Answer: Backtracking is a technique used to solve problems by trying all possible solutions and then eliminating those that don't work until a successful solution is found.

2. What is the difference between backtracking and brute force? 
Answer: Brute force tries every possible solution in a systematic manner, whereas backtracking intelligently eliminates branches of the solution tree that are likely to be unsuccessful.

3. What is a common problem that can be solved by backtracking? 
Answer: Sudoku puzzles are a common problem that can be solved using backtracking.

4. What is the role of pruning in backtracking? 
Answer: Pruning involves the elimination of branches of the solution tree that are certain to lead to an unsuccessful solution, thus reducing the number of possibilities that need to be explored.

5. How does backtracking find a solution? 
Answer: Backtracking explores all possible solutions, one at a time, by making a series of guesses and then backtracking when one of those guesses leads to an unsuccessful solution. Finally, it arrives at a successful solution by elimination.
