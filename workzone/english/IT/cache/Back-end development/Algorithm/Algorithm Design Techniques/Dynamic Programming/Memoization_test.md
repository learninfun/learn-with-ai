1. What is memoization, and how does it work?
A: Memoization is a programming technique used to speed up the execution of functions by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

2. Can memoization be used to speed up any type of function?
A: Memoization can be used to speed up functions that are deterministic, meaning they always produce the same output for the same inputs. Functions that have side effects or produce random output cannot be memoized.

3. What is the time complexity of memoized functions?
A: The time complexity of memoized functions depends on the size of the cache, which is typically limited by available storage space. Memoization can reduce the time complexity of recursive functions from O(2^n) to O(n) in some cases.

4. What are some potential drawbacks of using memoization?
A: Memoization can lead to increased memory usage and possible cache collisions, especially for functions with a large number of possible input values. Memoization can also make code more complex and difficult to debug.

5. How can memoization be used in combination with dynamic programming?
A: Memoization can be used to cache the results of subproblems in a dynamic programming algorithm, allowing the algorithm to avoid redundant calculations and improve overall runtime. This is referred to as "top-down" dynamic programming with memoization.
