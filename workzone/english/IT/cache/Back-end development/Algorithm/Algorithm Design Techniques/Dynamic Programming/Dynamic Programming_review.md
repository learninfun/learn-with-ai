1. What is dynamic programming and why is it useful in computer science?

Answer: Dynamic programming is a methodology for solving complex problems that involve recursively breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is useful in computer science because it allows for more efficient problem-solving by avoiding redundant computations and storing the results of subproblems for future use.

2. What is the difference between top-down and bottom-up dynamic programming?

Answer: Top-down dynamic programming involves recursively breaking a problem down into smaller subproblems, solving them sequentially and storing their results in memory. Bottom-up dynamic programming involves solving subproblems incrementally and building up to the final solution.

3. What is the optimal substructure property and why is it important in dynamic programming?

Answer: The optimal substructure property is the property that states that the optimal solution to a problem can be obtained by combining the optimal solutions to its subproblems. It is important in dynamic programming because it allows for the creation of efficient algorithms that can solve complex problems by recursively breaking them down into smaller subproblems.

4. What is memoization and how does it relate to dynamic programming?

Answer: Memoization is a technique used in dynamic programming that involves storing the results of subproblems in memory to avoid repetitive computations. It is a form of caching that allows for faster computation and more efficient problem solving.

5. What is the time complexity of dynamic programming algorithms and how does it compare to other approaches?

Answer: The time complexity of dynamic programming algorithms depends on the specific problem being solved and the approach taken. However, in general, dynamic programming algorithms tend to have better time complexity than other approaches such as brute force or recursive algorithms. They can often solve problems in polynomial time, whereas other approaches may require exponential time.
