Approximation algorithms are a class of algorithms that find a suboptimal solution for a computation problem in a reasonable amount of time. These algorithms generally provide a solution that is not necessarily the best possible solution but is close enough to the optimal solution.

One example of an approximation algorithm is the Greedy algorithm for the Knapsack problem. The problem is to fill a knapsack with items of different weights and values, such that the value of the items in the knapsack is maximized, but the total weight of the knapsack does not exceed a given weight limit.

The Greedy algorithm sorts the items by their value-to-weight ratio and selects the items with the highest ratio until the knapsack is full. While this algorithm does not guarantee the optimal solution, it gives a solution that is within a ratio (1-1/e) of the optimal solution, where e is the mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.718.

Overall, approximation algorithms are useful when the computational complexity of finding the optimal solution is impractical, and fast solutions that are asymptotically close to the optimal solution are sufficient.
