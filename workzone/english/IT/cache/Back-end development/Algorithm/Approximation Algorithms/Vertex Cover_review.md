1. What is a Vertex Cover in a graph?
Answer: A Vertex Cover is a subset of vertices in a graph such that every edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the subset.

2. What is the minimum size of a Vertex Cover in a graph?
Answer: The minimum size of a Vertex Cover in a graph is the size of the smallest possible subset of vertices that satisfies the Vertex Cover condition.

3. What is the relationship between a Vertex Cover and an Independent Set in a graph?
Answer: A Vertex Cover and an Independent Set are complements of each other in a graph, meaning that a subset of vertices is a Vertex Cover if and only if its complement is an Independent Set.

4. Is finding a minimum Vertex Cover in a graph an NP-hard problem?
Answer: Yes, finding a minimum Vertex Cover in a graph is an NP-hard problem, meaning that it cannot be solved in polynomial time unless P=NP.

5. What is the brute force approach to finding a minimum Vertex Cover in a graph?
Answer: The brute force approach to finding a minimum Vertex Cover in a graph is to iterate through all possible subsets of vertices and check if each subset satisfies the Vertex Cover condition. This approach has an exponential time complexity and is not feasible for large graphs.
