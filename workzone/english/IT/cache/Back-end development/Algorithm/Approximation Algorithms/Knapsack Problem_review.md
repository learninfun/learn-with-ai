1. What is the Knapsack Problem?
Answer: The Knapsack Problem is a mathematical problem in which you have a set of items with different weights and values, and you have to fill a knapsack with a maximum weight limit while maximizing its total value.

2. What is a greedy approach to solving the Knapsack Problem?
Answer: A greedy approach involves choosing the item with the highest value-to-weight ratio and filling up the knapsack until it reaches its maximum capacity.

3. What is a dynamic programming approach to solving the Knapsack Problem?
Answer: A dynamic programming approach involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and solving them iteratively to find the optimal solution.

4. What is the difference between the 0/1 Knapsack Problem and the fractional Knapsack Problem?
Answer: The 0/1 Knapsack Problem only allows items to be either taken or left behind, whereas the fractional Knapsack Problem allows for fractions of items to be taken.

5. Why is the Knapsack Problem considered to be NP-complete?
Answer: The Knapsack Problem is considered to be NP-complete because it cannot be solved in polynomial time and its solution requires searching through all possible combinations of items, which becomes exponentially more complex as the number of items increases.
