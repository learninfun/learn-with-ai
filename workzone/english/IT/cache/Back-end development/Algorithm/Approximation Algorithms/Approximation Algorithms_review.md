1. What is the basic idea behind the greedy algorithm for Set Cover problem? 
Answer: The greedy algorithm for Set Cover problem selects a set with maximum number of uncovered elements and repeats this process till all the elements are covered.

2. What is the approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm for Max Cut problem? 
Answer: The approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm for Max Cut problem is 0.5.

3. What is the difference between an exact algorithm and an approximation algorithm? 
Answer: An exact algorithm gives a solution that is guaranteed to be optimal, while an approximation algorithm gives a solution that is guaranteed to be within a certain factor of the optimal solution.

4. What is the performance guarantee of the 2-approximation algorithm for Vertex Cover problem?
Answer: The 2-approximation algorithm for Vertex Cover problem gives a solution that is guaranteed to be at most two times the optimal solution.

5. What is the time complexity of the greedy algorithm for Knapsack problem? 
Answer: The time complexity of the greedy algorithm for Knapsack problem is O(n log n), where n is the number of items.
