Vertex Cover is a problem in graph theory where we need to find the smallest set of vertices in a graph, such that for every edge in the graph, at least one of its endpoints belongs to the set. In other words, a Vertex Cover is a set of vertices that "covers" all the edges in the graph.

For example, let's consider the following graph:

```
           A
         /   \
        B     C
       /  \   |
      D    E  F
```

In this graph, the set of vertices [B, C, D] is a Vertex Cover, because:

- Edge AB is covered by vertex B
- Edge AC is covered by vertex C
- Edge BD is covered by vertex D
- Edge BE is covered by vertex B
- Edge CF is covered by vertex C

We can verify that for every edge in the graph, at least one of its endpoints belongs to the Vertex Cover. 

Note that there can be multiple Vertex Covers for a given graph, but we want to find the smallest one (i.e., with the minimum number of vertices).
