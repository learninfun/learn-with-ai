1. What is the best-case time complexity for a binary search algorithm? 

Answer: The best-case time complexity for a binary search algorithm is O(1), where the element being searched for is found at the middle of the list. 

2. What is the best-case time complexity for a bubble sort algorithm? 

Answer: The best-case time complexity for a bubble sort algorithm is O(n), where the list is already sorted and no swaps are needed. 

3. What is the best-case time complexity for a selection sort algorithm? 

Answer: The best-case time complexity for a selection sort algorithm is O(n^2), as the algorithm must always iterate through the list to find the smallest element. 

4. What is the best-case time complexity for a hash table lookup? 

Answer: The best-case time complexity for a hash table lookup is O(1), as the hash function can immediately determine the index of the value being searched for. 

5. What is the best-case time complexity for a linear search algorithm? 

Answer: The best-case time complexity for a linear search algorithm is O(1), where the element is found at the first index of the list.
