Time complexity analysis is a way to measure how much time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. It is a fundamental concept in computer science that helps in evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm.

For example, consider the following algorithm for calculating the sum of the first n natural numbers:

1. Initialize the sum to 0

2. Iterate from 1 to n:

   a. Add the current value of the iterator to the sum

3. Return the sum

To perform time complexity analysis, we have to count the number of operations performed by the algorithm as a function of n. In this case, we have one operation for initializing the sum, n operations for the iterative loop, and one operation for returning the sum. Therefore, the total number of operations is:

T(n) = 1 + n + 1 = n + 2

Thus, the time complexity of this algorithm for calculating the sum of the first n natural numbers is O(n), which means that the time it takes to run the algorithm grows linearly with the size of its input (n).
