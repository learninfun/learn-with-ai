1. What is the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm that loops through an array of n elements and performs a constant-time operation on each element?
Answer: O(n)

2. What is the worst-case time complexity of a sorting algorithm that uses the bubble sort algorithm method?
Answer: O(n^2)

3. What is the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm that recursively computes the Fibonacci sequence up to a number n, if the algorithm re-computes the same value multiple times?
Answer: O(2^n)

4. What is the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm that uses binary search to find an element in an array of n elements?
Answer: O(log n)

5. What is the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm that uses the quicksort algorithm to sort an array of n elements, if the array is already in sorted order?
Answer: O(n^2)
