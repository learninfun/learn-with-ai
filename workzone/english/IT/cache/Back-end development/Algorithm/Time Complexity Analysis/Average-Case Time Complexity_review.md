1. What is the average-case time complexity of quicksort when all the elements in the array are randomly distributed?

Answer: The average-case time complexity of quicksort is O(n log n).

2. When does the average-case time complexity of an algorithm become worse than the worst-case?

Answer: The average-case time complexity of an algorithm becomes worse than the worst-case when the probability of worst-case input increases.

3. What is the average-case time complexity of linear search if the element being searched is present in the middle of the array?

Answer: The average-case time complexity of linear search is O(n/2).

4. When is it appropriate to use average-case time complexity as a measure of algorithm performance?

Answer: It is appropriate to use average-case time complexity as a measure of algorithm performance when the input data is expected to be randomly distributed.

5. What is the average-case time complexity of binary search if all the elements in the array are sorted and the element being searched is not present in the array?

Answer: The average-case time complexity of binary search is O(log n).
