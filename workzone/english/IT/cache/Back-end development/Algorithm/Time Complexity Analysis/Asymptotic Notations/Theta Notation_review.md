1. What is the Big-O notation for a function that takes Theta(n^2) time? Answer: O(n^2).
2. Is Theta(n) the same as O(n)? Answer: No, Theta(n) represents an exact upper bound while O(n) represents an asymptotic upper bound.
3. What is the algorithmic complexity of a function that executes a loop of n iterations, each iteration taking O(log n) time? Answer: Theta(n log n).
4. Can a function have a lower bound of Omega(n^2) and an upper bound of O(n log n)? Answer: No, the lower and upper bounds must have the same order of growth in Theta notation.
5. What is the growth rate classification of a function that takes Theta(1) time? Answer: Constant time complexity.
