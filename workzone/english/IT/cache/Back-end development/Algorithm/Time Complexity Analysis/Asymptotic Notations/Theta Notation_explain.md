Theta notation, also known as Big-Theta notation or asymptotic tight bound, is a mathematical representation used to describe the complexity or running time of an algorithm. It is used to define the upper and lower bounds of the algorithm's growth rate, which provides a better understanding of how the algorithm behaves for large input sizes.

Theta notation is denoted by Θ(n), where n represents the input size. If an algorithm's time complexity is Θ(n), it means that the algorithm's running time grows linearly with the input size. This means that if the input size doubles, the running time will also double.

For example, consider an algorithm that performs a linear search to find an element in an array of n elements. In the worst case scenario, the search may need to examine all n elements, so the time complexity can be represented as Θ(n). This means that as the size of the array grows, the algorithm's running time grows at the same rate.

Another example can be the insertion sort algorithm, which has a time complexity of Θ(n^2). This means that the running time of the algorithm grows quadratically with the input size. In the case of insertion sort, doubling the input size results in a four times increase in the running time.

Overall, Theta notation is useful in determining how efficiently an algorithm can perform for different input sizes and helps in selecting the best algorithm for a specific use case.
