Big O Notation is a way of describing how the time taken to execute an algorithm increases as the size of the input increases. It is used to analyze the efficiency of an algorithm.

In general, Big O notation describes the upper bound of the time complexity of an algorithm. It tells us how fast the algorithm will be at its worst case scenario.

Big O Notation is represented by the capital letter “O” and a function of n, where n is the size of the input. Some common examples of Big O Notation include O(1), O(n), O(n^2), O(log n), O(n log n), etc.

- O(1) means that the algorithm's time complexity is constant, which means that it will always run in the same amount of time regardless of the size of the input. For example, getting the first element of an array takes constant time (O(1)) because it does not depend on the size of the array.

- O(n) means that the algorithm's time complexity grows linearly in proportion to the size of the input. For example, summing up the elements of an array takes O(n) time because it depends on the number of elements in the array.

- O(n^2) means that the algorithm's time complexity grows exponentially in relation to the size of the input. For example, comparing each pair of elements in an array takes O(n^2) time as we have nested loops to compare every element with every other element.

Overall, Big O Notation is a way to describe the upper bound of the time complexity of an algorithm, and it is used to analyze the efficiency and scalability of an algorithm.
