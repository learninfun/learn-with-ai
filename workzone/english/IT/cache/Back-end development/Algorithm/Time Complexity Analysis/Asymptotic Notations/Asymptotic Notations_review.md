1) What is the equation for the notation O(log n)?
Answer: O(log n) means that the time complexity of the algorithm or function is logarithmic, calculated as O(log n) where n is the input size.

2) What is the difference between Omega and Theta notations?
Answer: Omega notation represents the lower bound of the algorithm's time complexity, while Theta notation represents both upper and lower bounds.

3) What is the time complexity of an algorithm with the notation O(n^2) if n = 10?
Answer: The time complexity would be O(100), which simplifies to O(1) because 100 is a constant.

4) How would the time complexity of an algorithm be affected if a constant is added inside the notation?
Answer: Adding a constant inside the notation does not affect the time complexity, since constants are not considered in asymptotic analysis.

5) Can an algorithm have both an upper and lower bound of O(n)?
Answer: Yes, an algorithm can have both an upper and lower bound of O(n) if the best and worst case scenarios have a linear time complexity. This would be represented by the Theta notation Î˜(n).
