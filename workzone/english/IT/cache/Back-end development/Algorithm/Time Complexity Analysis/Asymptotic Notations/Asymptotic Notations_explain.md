Asymptotic notations are mathematical tools used in computer science to describe the growth rate of a function or an algorithm's time complexity as the input size approaches infinity. In other words, it helps in analyzing the running time of an algorithm.

There are three commonly used notations for representing the running time of an algorithm related to its input size:

1. Big O notation (upper bound): It represents the worst-case scenario of an algorithm. It is used to describe the upper limit of a function or algorithm by using an equation f(n) ≤ c*g(n).

Example: The time complexity of linear search algorithm is O(n) as the number of comparisons made by the algorithm increases linearly with the size of the input.

2. Omega notation (lower bound): It represents the best-case scenario of an algorithm. It is used to describe the lower limit of a function or algorithm by using an equation f(n) ≥ c*g(n).

Example: The time complexity of merge sort algorithm is Ω(n log n), as it takes at least O(n log n) comparisons.

3. Theta notation (tight bound): It represents both the upper and lower bounds of an algorithm. It is used to describe the precise growth rate of a function or algorithm by using an equation c1*g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c2 * g(n), where c1 and c2 are constants.

Example: The time complexity of quicksort algorithm is Θ(n log n), as its best-case scenario is Ω(n log n) and worst-case scenario is O(n^2), but on average it takes O(n log n) comparisons.

In summary, asymptotic notations are used to analyze the running time of algorithms and provide a way to compare their efficiency. They help in choosing the best algorithm for a specific problem based on its time complexity.
