1. What is the time complexity of an algorithm that has nested for loops with n iterations each? 
Answer: O(n^2)

2. What is the difference between a recursive algorithm and an iterative algorithm? 
Answer: A recursive algorithm uses function calls to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems, whereas an iterative algorithm uses loops to repeatedly execute the same code with different values.

3. What is dynamic programming and how can it be used to optimize algorithms? 
Answer: Dynamic programming is a technique that involves solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems and storing the solutions to those sub-problems for future use. This can optimize algorithms by reducing redundant calculations and improving overall efficiency.

4. What is the purpose of a sorting algorithm and what are some common examples? 
Answer: The purpose of a sorting algorithm is to arrange a set of data in a specified order, such as ascending or descending. Common examples include bubble sort, insertion sort, and quicksort.

5. How do you calculate the space complexity of an algorithm? 
Answer: To calculate the space complexity of an algorithm, you need to analyze how much memory it requires to run. This includes the memory used for variables, data structures, and any recursive function calls or nested loops.
