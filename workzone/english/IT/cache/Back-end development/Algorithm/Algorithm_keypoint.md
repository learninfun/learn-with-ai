1. An algorithm is a set of instructions or steps to solve a specific problem or complete a task.
2. It is usually expressed in a computer programming language or a pseudocode.
3. The solution to the problem should be efficient and accurate.
4. Algorithms can be analyzed based on their time complexity and space complexity.
5. They can be recursive or iterative.
6. Algorithms can be classified as sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, graph algorithms, and more.
7. The design of an algorithm should be based on the problem requirements, input/output data, and available resources.
8. The development, testing, and optimization of algorithms are essential in computer science and other fields.
