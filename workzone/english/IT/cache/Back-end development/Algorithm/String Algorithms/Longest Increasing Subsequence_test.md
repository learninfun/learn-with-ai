1. What is the longest increasing subsequence of the sequence 2, 5, 3, 7, 11, 8, 10?
Answer: The longest increasing subsequence is 2, 3, 7, 8, 10.

2. What is the time complexity of the longest increasing subsequence algorithm using dynamic programming?
Answer: The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the length of the sequence.

3. Can the longest increasing subsequence of a sequence consist of just one element?
Answer: Yes, the longest increasing subsequence of a sequence can consist of just one element.

4. How many longest increasing subsequences can a sequence have?
Answer: A sequence can have multiple longest increasing subsequences, but they all have the same length.

5. What is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a sequence to make it an increasing sequence?
Answer: The minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a sequence to make it an increasing sequence is equal to the length of the sequence minus the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
