1. What is the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the sequence {3, 4, 2, 8, 10, 5, 1}?
Answer: The length of the longest increasing subsequence is 3, which can be obtained by selecting the sequence {3, 4, 8}.

2. What is the time complexity of the dynamic programming algorithm used to find the longest increasing subsequence?
Answer: The time complexity of the dynamic programming algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input sequence.

3. Given the sequence {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, what is the length of the longest increasing subsequence?
Answer: The length of the longest increasing subsequence is 6, which is equal to the length of the input sequence.

4. How many longest increasing subsequences can a given sequence have?
Answer: A given sequence can have multiple longest increasing subsequences, but they will all have the same length.

5. What is the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the sequence {10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18}?
Answer: The length of the longest increasing subsequence is 4, which can be obtained by selecting the sequence {2, 5, 7, 101}.
