1. Rabin-Karp Algorithm is a pattern matching algorithm.
2. It uses hash values and rolling hash technique to find a pattern in a text string.
3. It has a time complexity of O(n+m), where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern.
4. It is particularly useful when the pattern has many characters in common with the text.
5. Rabin-Karp Algorithm uses a sliding window technique to calculate hash values of substrings of the text.
6. It compares the hash value of the pattern with the hash value of each substring to find a match.
7. In case of a hash collision, it verifies the match by comparing the pattern with substring character by character.
8. The algorithm can be optimized by using a prime number for the hash function and implementing a rolling hash technique.
9. It is a versatile algorithm and can be used in various applications such as plagiarism detection, spell checking, and DNA sequence analysis.
