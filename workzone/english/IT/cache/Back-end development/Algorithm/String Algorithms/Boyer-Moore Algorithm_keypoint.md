1. Boyer-Moore Algorithm is used for pattern matching in a given text string.

2. This algorithm is based on two major ideas: the "bad character rule" and the "good suffix rule".

3. The bad character rule states that if a mismatch is found while comparing the pattern with the text, then we shift the pattern until the rightmost occurrence of the character in the pattern that doesn't match the corresponding character in the text.

4. The good suffix rule is used when we find a match between the pattern and the text. It states that we can shift the pattern to the right by the difference between the length of the pattern and the position of the last occurrence of the matching suffix.

5. Boyer-Moore Algorithm is efficient for large pattern matching as it reduces the number of comparisons required.

6. The worst-case time complexity of this algorithm is O(mn), where m is the length of the pattern and n is the length of the text. However, in practice, it performs much faster than the other pattern matching algorithms.
