1. What is the time complexity of Rabin-Karp algorithm for average case scenario?
Answer: The average case time complexity of Rabin-Karp algorithm is O(n+m), where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern.

2. Can Rabin-Karp algorithm handle multiple pattern matching?
Answer: Yes, Rabin-Karp algorithm can handle multiple pattern matching by preprocessing all patterns and searching for them in the text.

3. What are the advantages of Rabin-Karp algorithm over other string matching algorithms?
Answer: Rabin-Karp algorithm has advantages like handling multiple pattern matching, easy implementation, and good average case time complexity.

4. How does Rabin-Karp algorithm work?
Answer: Rabin-Karp algorithm works by hashing the pattern and all possible substrings of the text, and then comparing the hash values to find a match.

5. Is Rabin-Karp algorithm suitable for large texts and patterns?
Answer: No, Rabin-Karp algorithm may not be suitable for large texts and patterns due to the high memory requirements and the risk of hash collisions.
