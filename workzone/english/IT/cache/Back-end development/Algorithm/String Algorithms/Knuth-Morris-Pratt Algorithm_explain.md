The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is a string-matching algorithm that is used to find a pattern within a larger text string. It works by pre-computing a prefix function of the pattern, which is used to skip comparisons that are guaranteed to fail. This makes the algorithm more efficient than simple approaches such as brute force.

To use the KMP algorithm, we first construct a prefix function for the pattern string. This function maps each position in the pattern to the length of the longest proper prefix that is also a suffix of the substring up to that position.

For example, consider the pattern string "ABABCABAB". The prefix function for this string is as follows:

    Prefix function values for "ABABCABAB":
    A B A B C A B A B
    0 0 1 2 0 1 2 3 4

Using this prefix function, we can search for the pattern within a larger text string. We start by comparing the first character of the pattern to the first character of the text. If they match, we move on to compare the second character of the pattern to the second character of the text, and so on.

If at any point the characters do not match, we can use the prefix function to skip ahead in the pattern. Specifically, we look up the prefix value for the position in the pattern that we've reached, and move the pattern forward by that amount. We then continue the comparison from that new position.

For example, suppose we want to find the pattern "ABABCABAB" within the text string "ABABDABABCABABEF". We start by comparing the first character of the pattern ("A") to the first character of the text ("A"), and they match. We then compare the second characters ("B" and "B"), which also match. We continue this way until we get to the seventh character in the pattern ("A"), which does not match the seventh character in the text ("C").

At this point, we use the prefix function to determine how much to shift the pattern forward. The prefix value for position 6 in the pattern is 2, so we shift the pattern forward by 5 characters (the length of "ABABC"), and continue the comparison from there.

We repeat this process until we either find the pattern or reach the end of the text. In this case, we find the pattern starting at position 6 in the text.

While the KMP algorithm may seem complicated at first, it offers significant performance benefits in terms of time complexity. Specifically, it has a worst-case time complexity of O(m+n), where m is the length of the pattern and n is the length of the text. This makes it a useful tool in many applications, such as text editors and search engines.
