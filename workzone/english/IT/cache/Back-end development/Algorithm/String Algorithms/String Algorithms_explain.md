String algorithms are a set of techniques and methods used to manipulate and process strings, which are sequences of characters. These algorithms can be used in a wide range of applications, such as text processing, search engines, bioinformatics, data compression, and cryptography.

One example of a string algorithm is the string matching algorithm, which is used to find occurrences of a given pattern in a given string. The most commonly used algorithm for string matching is the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm, which uses a prefix function to avoid unnecessary comparisons when matching the pattern to the string. 

To illustrate the KMP algorithm, consider the task of finding all occurrences of the pattern "ABC" in the string "ABCDABCABCDABCD". The algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. Construct the prefix function for the pattern "ABC":

   a. Create an array P of the same length as the pattern, initialized to all zeroes.
   
   b. Set P[0] = -1 and P[1] = 0.
   
   c. Iterate over the pattern from the third character until the end, updating P[i] as follows:
   
      i. Set k = P[i-1].
      
      ii. While k >= 0 and pattern[k+1] != pattern[i], set k = P[k].
      
      iii. If pattern[k+1] == pattern[i], set P[i] = k + 1; otherwise, set P[i] = -1.

2. Use the prefix function to match the pattern to the string:

   a. Set i = 0 and j = 0.
   
   b. While i < n (the length of the string) and j < m (the length of the pattern), do the following:
   
      i. If string[i] == pattern[j], increment i and j.
      
      ii. If j == m (the pattern has been matched), add i - m to the list of occurrences and set j = P[j].
      
      iii. If string[i] != pattern[j] and j > 0, set j = P[j]; otherwise, increment i.

3. The algorithm returns a list of all starting positions of the pattern in the string: [3, 7].

In summary, the KMP algorithm uses the prefix function to skip over parts of the string that cannot possibly match the pattern, making it more efficient than a simple brute-force search.
