1. What is a Trie data structure and how is it used?

A Trie (pronounced "try") is a tree-like data structure used to store data in a way that makes it easy to search and retrieve information. It is commonly used in search engines and spell checkers.

2. What is the time complexity of searching for a word in a Trie data structure?

The time complexity of searching for a word in a Trie data structure is O(m), where m is the length of the word. This is because the search can be done by following a path from the root node to the leaf node that represents the last character of the word.

3. How does Trie data structure differ from a hash table?

Both Trie and hash tables are used for data storage and retrieval. However, Trie data structure is used to store strings and is more suited for prefix-based searching, whereas hash tables are used for key-value pairs and are more suited for exact match searching.

4. Can a Trie data structure be used to store integers?

Yes, a Trie data structure can be used to store integers. However, the integers need to be converted to strings before storing them in the Trie.

5. How can a Trie data structure be used to implement auto-complete functionality?

Auto-complete functionality can be implemented using Trie data structure by traversing the Trie to find all the words that start with the prefix entered by the user. These words can then be displayed as suggestions for auto-complete.
