1. What is the Boyer-Moore algorithm used for?
Answer: The Boyer-Moore algorithm is used for pattern searching in a text string.

2. How does the Boyer-Moore algorithm differ from other pattern searching algorithms?
Answer: The Boyer-Moore algorithm uses two heuristics: the bad character rule and the good suffix rule, which allow it to skip over parts of the text string that cannot match the pattern.

3. What is the bad character rule in the Boyer-Moore algorithm?
Answer: The bad character rule is used to determine how far the pattern can be shifted to the right based on a mismatched character in the text string.

4. What is the good suffix rule in the Boyer-Moore algorithm?
Answer: The good suffix rule is used to determine how far the pattern can be shifted to the right based on a matched suffix in the pattern.

5. What is the time complexity of the Boyer-Moore algorithm?
Answer: The time complexity of the Boyer-Moore algorithm is O(n+m), where n is the length of the text string and m is the length of the pattern.
