1. Space complexity analysis determines the amount of memory space that an algorithm requires to run.

2. It considers the amount of memory required by an algorithm as a function of the size of the input.

3. The space complexity of an algorithm is usually expressed in terms of the Big O notation.

4. Different algorithms solve the same problem can have different space complexities.

5. Space complexity can be affected by the data structures used by an algorithm, such as arrays, lists, trees, or priority queues.

6. Recursive algorithms, like quicksort or merge sort, can have high space complexity due to the large number of function calls performed.

7. Space complexity analysis is essential when working with large data sets, as it allows us to estimate the amount of memory required before running the algorithm.
