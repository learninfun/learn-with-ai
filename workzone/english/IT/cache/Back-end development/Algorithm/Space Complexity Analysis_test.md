1. What is space complexity analysis?
Answer: Space complexity analysis is a method of determining the amount of memory or space required by an algorithm as it runs.

2. How is space complexity different from time complexity?
Answer: Time complexity analysis measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, while space complexity analyzes the amount of memory the algorithm uses.

3. What factors affect the space complexity of an algorithm?
Answer: The input size, data types used, and storage requirements of variables and data structures are all factors that can affect the space complexity of an algorithm.

4. What is the Big O notation used for in space complexity analysis?
Answer: The Big O notation is commonly used to express the upper limit or worst-case scenario for the amount of space an algorithm will use during its execution.

5. How can space complexity analysis be used to optimize an algorithm?
Answer: By understanding the space requirements of an algorithm, it may be possible to optimize it by using more efficient data structures, reducing unnecessary data duplication, or implementing other space-saving techniques.
