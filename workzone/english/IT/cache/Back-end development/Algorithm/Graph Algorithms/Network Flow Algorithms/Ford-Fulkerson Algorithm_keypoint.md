1. The Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm is an algorithm for finding the maximum flow in a flow network.

2. The algorithm works by starting with an initial feasible flow and then iteratively finding augmenting paths that increase the flow.

3. An augmenting path is a path from the source to the sink that has available capacity, which can be used to increase the flow.

4. The algorithm terminates when there are no more augmenting paths to be found, at which point the flow is at maximum.

5. The algorithm uses a residual graph to keep track of available capacity and flow along the edges.

6. The residual graph is created by subtracting the current flow from the capacity of each edge.

7. The algorithm can use either the Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search algorithm to find augmenting paths.

8. The maximum flow can be found by summing the flows along all the edges leaving the source.

9. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(E*max flow), where E is the number of edges in the graph.

10. The Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm is often used as the basis for more advanced algorithms, such as the Dinic's Algorithm and the Edmonds-Karp Algorithm.
