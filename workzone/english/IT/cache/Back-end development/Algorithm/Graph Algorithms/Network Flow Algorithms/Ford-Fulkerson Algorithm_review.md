1. What is the purpose of the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm?
Answer: The Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm is used to find the maximum flow in a network flow problem.

2. What is the time complexity of the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm?
Answer: The worst-case time complexity of the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm is O(Ef), where E is the number of edges in the graph and f is the maximum flow.

3. What is the difference between the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm and the Edmonds-Karp Algorithm?
Answer: The Edmonds-Karp Algorithm is a variant of the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm that uses breadth-first search to find the augmenting path, which results in a faster runtime.

4. What is the role of residual capacity in the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm?
Answer: The residual capacity is the amount of additional flow that can be sent through an edge that is already carrying some flow. It is used to update the graph after each iteration of the algorithm.

5. How does the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm handle situations where multiple paths have the same residual capacity?
Answer: The Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm uses a depth-first search to find the augmenting path, and will always choose the first path it finds. Therefore, if there are multiple paths with the same residual capacity, the algorithm may not find the optimal solution.
