1) What is the time complexity of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm?
Answer: The time complexity of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm is O(V^2 * E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

2) How does the Edmonds-Karp algorithm differ from the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm?
Answer: The Edmonds-Karp algorithm uses a breadth-first search to find the augmenting path, whereas the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm uses any path in the residual graph. This ensures that the Edmonds-Karp algorithm has a better worst-case time complexity.

3) Can the Edmonds-Karp algorithm handle graphs with negative edge weights?
Answer: No, the Edmonds-Karp algorithm requires non-negative edge weights to find the max-flow in a graph.

4) What is the significance of the bottleneck capacity in the Edmonds-Karp algorithm?
Answer: The bottleneck capacity is the minimum capacity of all edges in the augmenting path. It represents the maximum amount of flow that can be added along that path, and is used to update the residual graph and the flow network.

5) Is the max-flow obtained by the Edmonds-Karp algorithm always unique?
Answer: No, there can be multiple ways to obtain the same max-flow in a graph. The Edmonds-Karp algorithm may find different augmenting paths and update the flow network differently each time it is run, but the resulting max-flow will still be the same.
