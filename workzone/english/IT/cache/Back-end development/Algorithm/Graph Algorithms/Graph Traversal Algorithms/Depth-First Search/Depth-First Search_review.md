1. What is the running time complexity of Depth-First Search on an adjacency matrix?
Answer: The running time complexity of Depth-First Search on an adjacency matrix is O(V^2) where V is the number of vertices in the graph.

2. Can Depth-First Search be used to find the shortest path in a weighted graph?
Answer: No, Depth-First Search cannot be used to find the shortest path in a weighted graph since it does not take weights into consideration.

3. What is the difference between Preorder and Postorder traversals in Depth-First Search?
Answer: The Preorder traversal in Depth-First Search visits the parent node before its children, while the Postorder traversal visits the parent node after its children.

4. How does Depth-First Search differ from Breadth-First Search?
Answer: Depth-First Search explores a graph by going as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking, while Breadth-First Search explores a graph by visiting all adjacent vertices before moving on to the next level.

5. What is the purpose of marking nodes in Depth-First Search?
Answer: Marking nodes in Depth-First Search is used to keep track of which nodes have already been visited or processed to avoid revisiting them again. This helps to prevent infinite loops and ensures that all nodes are visited exactly once.
