1. What is a Topological Sort?
Answer: A Topological Sort is an algorithm that arranges the nodes in a directed acyclic graph in such a way that for every directed edge (u,v), node u comes before node v in the topological ordering.

2. What is the time complexity of a Topological Sort algorithm?
Answer: The time complexity of a Topological Sort algorithm is O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the directed graph.

3. What is the significance of a Topological Sort?
Answer: Topological Sorting has widespread application in solving problems related to task scheduling or in finding the order in which a set of tasks should be executed.

4. Can a graph with cycles be topologically sorted?
Answer: No, a graph with cycles cannot be topologically sorted as a Topological Sort only works for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

5. What is the difference between a DFS-based and a BFS-based Topological Sort algorithm?
Answer: The DFS-based Topological Sort algorithm uses a stack to keep track of the nodes in the order they are visited, whereas the BFS-based algorithm uses a queue. The DFS-based algorithm is usually more efficient for large graphs with few edges, while the BFS-based algorithm is more efficient for dense graphs with many edges.
