1. Q: In what order are the nodes visited during a Breadth-First Search?
   A: The nodes are visited level-by-level, starting from the root node and moving onto its immediate neighbors in the next level.

2. Q: Does Breadth-First Search guarantee the shortest path between two nodes in a graph?
   A: Yes, Breadth-First Search guarantees the shortest path between two nodes in a graph since it visits nodes in order of their distance from the starting node.

3. Q: Can Breadth-First Search be used to detect cycles in a graph?
   A: No, Breadth-First Search cannot be used to detect cycles in a graph since it only detects the shortest path between two nodes and does not keep track of previously visited nodes.

4. Q: How is Breadth-First Search different from Depth-First Search?
   A: Breadth-First Search visits all the nodes level-by-level, while Depth-First Search explores a single path as far as possible before backtracking.

5. Q: What data structure is typically used for implementing Breadth-First Search?
   A: The most commonly used data structure for implementing Breadth-First Search is a queue. This is because the nodes need to be visited in the same order as they were added to the queue.
