1. What is a topological sort and how does it work?
2. How is topological sort used in real-world applications such as scheduling and project management?
3. What are the different algorithms for performing topological sort?
4. Can a topological sort be performed on a graph with cycles? If not, why?
5. How does the time complexity of topological sort vary depending on the algorithm used and the size of the graph?
