1. What is Prim's Algorithm used for?
Answer: Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used for finding the minimum spanning tree of a weighted undirected graph.

2. How does Prim's Algorithm work?
Answer: Prim's Algorithm starts with a vertex and adds the minimum weight edge that connects it to an unvisited vertex. It then repeats this process by adding the minimum weight edge that connects any already visited vertices to unvisited vertices until all vertices have been visited.

3. What is the time complexity of Prim's Algorithm?
Answer: The time complexity of Prim's Algorithm is O(ElogV) where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.

4. Is Prim's Algorithm guaranteed to find the minimum spanning tree?
Answer: Yes, Prim's Algorithm is guaranteed to find the minimum spanning tree of a weighted undirected graph.

5. Can Prim's Algorithm be used on a directed graph?
Answer: No, Prim's Algorithm can only be used on an undirected graph because it requires finding the minimum weight edge between any two vertices, regardless of the direction of the edge.
