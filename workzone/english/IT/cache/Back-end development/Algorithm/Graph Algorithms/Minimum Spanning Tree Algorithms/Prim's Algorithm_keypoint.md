1. Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the minimum spanning tree of an undirected graph.
2. The algorithm starts with a given vertex and adds the nearest neighbour to the tree set.
3. The algorithm chooses the minimum edge weight while adding vertices to the tree set.
4. The algorithm terminates when all vertices have been added to the tree set.
5. The algorithm requires a priority queue to store the minimum weight edge at each step.
6. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(E log V).
7. Prim's Algorithm can be used in both dense and sparse graphs.
