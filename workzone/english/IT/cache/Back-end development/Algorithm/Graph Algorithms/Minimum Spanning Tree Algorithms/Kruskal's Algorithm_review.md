1. What is Kruskal's algorithm used for?
- Kruskal's algorithm is used for finding the minimum spanning tree of a connected weighted graph.

2. How does Kruskal's algorithm work?
- Kruskal's algorithm works by sorting the edges of a graph by weight and then selecting the edges in increasing order of weight to build a minimum spanning tree.

3. What is the time complexity of Kruskal's algorithm?
- The time complexity of Kruskal's algorithm is O(E log E), where E is the number of edges in the graph.

4. How does Kruskal's algorithm handle disconnected graphs?
- If Kruskal's algorithm encounters a disconnected graph, it will simply find the minimum spanning tree for each connected component of the graph.

5. What is the output of Kruskal's algorithm?
- The output of Kruskal's algorithm is the set of edges that form the minimum spanning tree of the input graph.
