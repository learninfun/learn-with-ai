Prim's Algorithm is a commonly used algorithm in computer science that is used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a given graph. The MST is the subset of edges that connects all the vertices of a graph without forming a cycle, while minimizing the total weight of the tree.

Prim's Algorithm starts by selecting an arbitrary vertex, adding it to the MST and marking it as visited. Then, it examines all the edges connected to this vertex and chooses the one with the minimum weight that leads to an unvisited vertex. It then adds this vertex to the MST, marks it as visited, and repeats the process until all the vertices have been included in the MST.

Example: 

Let's consider the following weighted undirected graph with 6 vertices and 7 edges:

We will use Prim's Algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of this graph:

Step 1: Select an arbitrary vertex (let's choose vertex A) and add it to the MST.

Step 2: Consider all the edges that are connected to vertex A and choose the one with the minimum weight that leads to an unvisited vertex. This edge is AB with weight 2. Add vertex B to the MST and mark it as visited.

Step 3: Consider all the edges that are connected to vertices A and B, and choose the one with the minimum weight that leads to an unvisited vertex. This edge is CD with weight 3. Add vertex C to the MST and mark it as visited.

Step 4: Consider all the edges that are connected to vertices A, B, and C, and choose the one with the minimum weight that leads to an unvisited vertex. This edge is BE with weight 4. Add vertex E to the MST and mark it as visited.

Step 5: Consider all the edges that are connected to vertices A, B, C, and E, and choose the one with the minimum weight that leads to an unvisited vertex. This edge is AD with weight 5. Add vertex D to the MST and mark it as visited.

Step 6: Consider all the edges that are connected to vertices A, B, C, E, and D, and choose the one with the minimum weight that leads to an unvisited vertex. This edge is CE with weight 1. Add vertex E to the MST and mark it as visited.

After Step 6, all the vertices have been included in the MST, and we have found the minimum spanning tree of the graph:
