1. What is Kruskal's Algorithm used for?
Answer: Kruskal's Algorithm is a popular algorithm used to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph.

2. What is the basic idea behind Kruskal's Algorithm?
Answer: Kruskal's Algorithm works by sorting the edges of a graph according to their weights and then adding them to the minimum spanning tree in increasing order of their weights.

3. How does Kruskal's Algorithm ensure that the minimum spanning tree is found?
Answer: Kruskal's Algorithm ensures that the minimum spanning tree is found by keeping track of the edges added to the tree and ensuring that they do not form a cycle.

4. What is the time complexity of Kruskal's Algorithm?
Answer: The time complexity of Kruskal's Algorithm is O(E log E), where E is the number of edges in the graph.

5. What is the difference between Kruskal's Algorithm and Prim's Algorithm?
Answer: Kruskal's Algorithm and Prim's Algorithm are both used to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph, but Kruskal's Algorithm is based on sorting the edges of the graph and adding them to the tree in increasing order, while Prim's Algorithm is based on starting with a single vertex and adding the closest unvisited vertex to the tree at each step.
