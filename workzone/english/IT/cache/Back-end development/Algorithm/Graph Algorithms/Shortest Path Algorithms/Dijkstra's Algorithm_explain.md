Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph. It solves the single-source shortest path problem by iteratively expanding the frontier set of vertices until the destination is reached. At each iteration, the algorithm chooses the vertex with the smallest tentative distance from the source and adds it to the frontier set.

Here is an example of how Dijkstra's algorithm works:

Suppose we have a weighted graph with five vertices and the following edges:

- Vertex A has edges to B (weight 10) and D (weight 5)
- Vertex B has edges to C (weight 1) and D (weight 2)
- Vertex C has an edge to E (weight 4)
- Vertex D has edges to B (weight 3), C (weight 9), and E (weight 2)
- Vertex E has no outgoing edges

We want to find the shortest path from vertex A to vertex E using Dijkstra's algorithm. 

The algorithm starts by initializing the distance from the source vertex to all other vertices as infinite except for the source vertex, which has a distance of zero. We also create a set of visited vertices that is initially empty.

1. Set the tentative distance to A to be 0 and add A to the visited set.
2. Choose the vertex with the smallest tentative distance (in this case A), which is already in the visited set.
3. For each neighbor of A (B and D), calculate the distance from A to the neighbor (the weight of the edge plus the tentative distance to A). If this distance is smaller than the current tentative distance to the neighbor, update the tentative distance to the smaller value.
4. Add B to the visited set, as it has the smallest tentative distance among the neighbors of A.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the next vertex in the visited set, which is B.
6. For each neighbor of B (C and D), calculate the distance from A to the neighbor (the weight of the edge plus the tentative distance to B). If this distance is smaller than the current tentative distance to the neighbor, update the tentative distance to the smaller value.
7. Add D to the visited set, as it has the smallest tentative distance among the neighbors of B.
8. Repeat steps 2-4 for the next vertex in the visited set, which is D.
9. For each neighbor of D (B, C, and E), calculate the distance from A to the neighbor (the weight of the edge plus the tentative distance to D). If this distance is smaller than the current tentative distance to the neighbor, update the tentative distance to the smaller value.
10. Add E to the visited set, as it has the smallest tentative distance among the neighbors of D.
11. The algorithm terminates when the destination vertex (E) is added to the visited set. The shortest path from A to E is the sequence of vertices that follow the tentative distance values backwards from E to A.

In this case, the shortest path from A to E is A -> D -> E with a total distance of 7.
