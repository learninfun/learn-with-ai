1. What is the basic difference between online algorithms and offline algorithms?
Answer: Online algorithms process input data as soon as they arrive, whereas offline algorithms process the entire input data before initiating program execution.

2. Can an online algorithm be deterministic?
Answer: Yes, an online algorithm can be deterministic if it always takes the same action for a given set of input data.

3. What are the advantages of using an online algorithm?
Answer: The advantages of using an online algorithm include improved responsiveness, reduced storage requirements, and adaptability to changing input data.

4. Why are greedy algorithms popularly used in online algorithms?
Answer: Greedy algorithms are popularly used in online algorithms because they are simple, efficient, and offer provable bounds on performance.

5. What is the competitive analysis of an online algorithm?
Answer: Competitive analysis is a way to compare the performance of an online algorithm against an offline algorithm. It measures the online algorithm's performance as a percentage of the performance of the offline algorithm, and the ratio between them is known as the competitive ratio.
