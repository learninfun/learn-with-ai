1. What is the difference between online and offline algorithms?
Answer: Offline algorithms have access to all input data at once, whereas online algorithms only have access to a portion of the input data at a time.

2. What is competitive analysis in online algorithms?
Answer: Competitive analysis compares the performance of an online algorithm against an ideal offline algorithm that has access to all input data. The goal is to ensure that the online algorithm performs as close to the ideal algorithm as possible.

3. What is the paging problem in online algorithms?
Answer: The paging problem refers to the challenge of efficiently managing memory in a computing system in which there is limited memory available.

4. What is the k-server problem in online algorithms?
Answer: The k-server problem is a type of online algorithm problem in which k servers are placed in a metric space, and the goal is to minimize the cost of serving requests from clients that are located at various points in the space.

5. What is the difference between deterministic and randomized online algorithms?
Answer: Deterministic online algorithms make decisions based on fixed rules, whereas randomized online algorithms use randomization to make decisions. Randomized algorithms often have better performance guarantees, but they may be less predictable than deterministic algorithms.
