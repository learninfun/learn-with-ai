1. Online algorithms are designed to process incoming data in real-time.

2. They make decisions based only on the information available at the time each decision is made.

3. They operate in a variety of applications such as packet routing, job scheduling and stock trading.

4. They have to balance the need for making quick decisions with the need for making accurate decisions.

5. They typically have lower memory requirements and better scalability than their offline counterparts.

6. They often use heuristics and approximation algorithms to make decisions in time constraints.

7. They require careful analysis and modelling to ensure their performance meets the requirements of the application.

8. They are subject to algorithmic complexities such as competitive analysis and regret minimization.

9. They are a rapidly evolving area of research, with many open problems and challenges yet to be solved.
