Q1. What is Online Convex Optimization?

A1. Online Convex Optimization is the process of minimizing a sequence of convex functions in an online setting, where the functions arrive one-by-one, and the decision maker must choose a decision after observing each function.

Q2. What is the difference between Online Convex Optimization and Batch Convex Optimization?

A2. Batch Convex Optimization minimizes a set of convex functions that are known in advance, while Online Convex Optimization minimizes a sequence of convex functions that are revealed one-by-one in an online setting. 

Q3. What are the main challenges in Online Convex Optimization?

A3. The main challenges in Online Convex Optimization are the uncertainty in the arrival of future functions, the need to make decisions in real-time, and the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.

Q4. What is the Online Gradient Descent algorithm?

A4. The Online Gradient Descent algorithm is a popular algorithm for Online Convex Optimization. It updates the decision variable in each round using a gradient descent step that is computed with respect to the current convex function and a regularization term that encourages solutions with small norm.

Q5. What are some applications of Online Convex Optimization?

A5. Online Convex Optimization has applications in recommendation systems, online advertising, portfolio optimization, and online control of autonomous systems.
