Sorting algorithms are a set of procedures that are used for arranging elements or data in a specific order. Sorting algorithms are primarily used to make it easier to search and analyze data in a variety of applications. There are many different types of sorting algorithms available, each with its advantages and disadvantages.

One example of a sorting algorithm is the bubble sort. The bubble sort is a simple and inefficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm repeats this process until the entire array is sorted.

For example, let's say we have an array of numbers: 7, 3, 5, 2, 9. To sort this array using the bubble sort, we start by comparing the first two elements, 7 and 3. Since 7 is greater than 3, we swap these elements, giving us the array: 3, 7, 5, 2, 9.

We then compare the next two elements, 7 and 5. Since 7 is still greater than 5, we swap these elements, giving us the array: 3, 5, 7, 2, 9.

We continue this process until the entire array is sorted, giving us the final array: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9. 

While the bubble sort is easy to understand and implement, it has a time complexity of O(n^2) and is not very efficient for large arrays.
