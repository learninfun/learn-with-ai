1. What is the time complexity of Merge Sort in worst-case scenarios?
- The time complexity of Merge Sort in worst-case scenarios is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements to be sorted.

2. How does the Merge Sort algorithm work?
- Merge Sort algorithm divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the two sorted halves to produce a sorted array.

3. What is the advantage of using Merge Sort over other sorting algorithms?
- The advantage of Merge Sort over other sorting algorithms is that it always has a time complexity of O(n log n) in all scenarios, regardless of the input order.

4. Why is Merge Sort considered a stable sorting algorithm?
- Merge Sort is considered a stable sorting algorithm because it maintains the relative order of equal elements in the input array during the merging process.

5. Can Merge Sort be performed in place?
- Yes, Merge Sort can be performed in place, but it requires additional memory for the merging process. Therefore, it is more efficient to perform Merge Sort using external memory.
