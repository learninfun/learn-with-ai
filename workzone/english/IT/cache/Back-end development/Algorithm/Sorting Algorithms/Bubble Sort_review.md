1. What is the time complexity of bubble sort?
Answer: The time complexity of bubble sort algorithm is O(n^2).

2. What makes bubble sort algorithm less efficient compared to other sorting algorithms?
Answer: Bubble sort algorithm is less efficient than other sorting algorithms because it requires many passes through the entire array to adequately sort the data.

3. How does bubble sorting work?
Answer: Bubble sort is a comparison-based algorithm that works by comparing adjacent pairs of elements and swapping them if they are not in the correct order. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted in ascending or descending order.

4. How do you implement bubble sort algorithm in programming?
Answer: Bubble sort algorithm can be implemented in programming using a loop that compares adjacent elements in an array and swaps them if they are not in order. The loop continues until the entire array is sorted.

5. What is an example of an application of bubble sort algorithm?
Answer: Bubble sort algorithm can be used in situations where the input data is small and the time complexity of the algorithm is not a significant concern. For instance, it could be used to sort a small collection of data in spreadsheet software.
