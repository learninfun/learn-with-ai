1. Insertion Sort algorithm is a simple and intuitive algorithm used to sort arrays and lists of elements.

2. It works by comparing each item in an array with the items before it, and shifting those items over to make room for the new item if necessary.

3. The algorithm starts with the first two elements in the array and compares them, swapping them if necessary to make sure the first element comes before the second.

4. The algorithm then moves on to the next element in the array and repeats the process, comparing it with all the elements that come before it and shifting them over if necessary.

5. Once the array is sorted, the algorithm terminates.

6. Insertion Sort has an average-case time complexity of O(n^2), which make it less efficient than other sorting algorithms like QuickSort and MergeSort.

7. However, it has a low space complexity and is relatively easy to implement, making it a good choice for small lists or as an optimization in other algorithms.
