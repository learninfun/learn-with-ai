1. Radix Sort is a non-comparative algorithm for sorting data. 
2. It is used for sorting integers and strings in ascending or descending order. 
3. Radix Sort is a linear time algorithm, which means its time complexity is O(n). 
4. The sorting is done by grouping numbers based on their digits or characters. 
5. Radix Sort uses bucket sort or counting sort to sort the numbers at each digit position. 
6. The digits or characters considered for sorting are processed from the least significant to the most significant. 
7. Radix Sort is stable, meaning it maintains the relative order of equal elements. 
8. The algorithm can be modified to handle negative numbers by using a two's complement representation. 
9. Radix Sort is commonly used for sorting large data sets with a fixed number of digits or characters. 
10. Radix Sort can be implemented in both iterative and recursive ways.
