1. What is the time complexity of Quick Sort in the worst case scenario?
Answer: The time complexity of Quick Sort in the worst case scenario is O(n^2).

2. How does Quick Sort work?
Answer: Quick Sort works by selecting a pivot element, partitioning the array into two sub-arrays - one with elements less than or equal to the pivot and the other with elements greater than or equal to the pivot. The process is then repeated recursively for each sub-array until the array is sorted.

3. What is the difference between Quick Sort and Merge Sort?
Answer: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that breaks down the array into smaller sub-arrays and then merges them back into a sorted array. Quick Sort also follows the divide-and-conquer approach but instead of breaking down the array, it partitions it into two sub-arrays using a pivot element.

4. Can Quick Sort be used for sorting data structures other than arrays?
Answer: Yes, Quick Sort can be used for sorting linked lists and other data structures as well.

5. What is the best scenario for Quick Sort in terms of time complexity?
Answer: The best scenario for Quick Sort in terms of time complexity is O(n*log n), achieved when the pivot element is always the median of the sub-array.
