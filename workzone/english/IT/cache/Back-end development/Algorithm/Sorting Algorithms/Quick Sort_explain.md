Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array of elements by partitioning the array into two sub-arrays based on a "pivot" element, and recursively sorting the sub-arrays. 

Here's an example of how a Quick Sort algorithm would work on an array of numbers:

1. Choose a pivot value from the array. For simplicity, let's choose the first element as the pivot, so pivot = 5.
2. Partition the array into two sub-arrays: one with elements less than the pivot, and one with elements greater than the pivot. In this case, we end up with [3, 2, 4] and [9, 7, 1, 6, 8], respectively.
3. Recursively sort the sub-arrays using the same Quick Sort algorithm. For the sub-array with elements less than the pivot, we choose 3 as the pivot, partition the array into [2] and [4], and recurse on each sub-array until we reach arrays of length 1 or 0. Since each of these sub-arrays is already sorted, we can combine them back into [2, 3, 4].
4. We repeat the above process for the sub-array with elements greater than the pivot: choose 9 as the pivot, partition into [7, 1, 6, 8] and [ ], recurse on the first sub-array to get [1, 6, 7, 8], and combine with the empty sub-array to get [1, 6, 7, 8, 9].
5. Finally, we combine the sorted sub-arrays from step 3 and step 4 to get the fully sorted array: [2, 3, 4, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9].
