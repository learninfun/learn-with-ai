1. What is the time complexity of the Quick Sort algorithm?
Answer: The worst-case time complexity of Quick Sort is O(n^2), while its average or best case time complexity is O(n*log n).

2. What is the stable sorting algorithm?
Answer: A stable sorting algorithm maintains the relative order of equal elements in the sorted array. Examples of stable sorting algorithms are Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, and Bubble Sort.

3. What is the in-place sorting algorithm?
Answer: An in-place sorting algorithm does not require additional memory to sort an array; it sorts the array in-place. Examples of in-place sorting algorithms include Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Shell Sort.

4. What is the difference between comparison-based and non-comparison-based sorting algorithms?
Answer: Comparison-based sorting algorithms compare elements using a comparison operator such as < or >. Examples of comparison-based algorithms are Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort. Non-comparison-based algorithms use a different approach to sort data, such as Counting Sort and Radix Sort.

5. What is the worst-case time complexity of Bubble Sort?
Answer: The worst-case time complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n^2). This is because the algorithm makes n-1 passes through the array, comparing each pair of adjacent elements and swapping them if needed.
