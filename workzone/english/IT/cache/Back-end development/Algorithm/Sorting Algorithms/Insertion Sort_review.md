1. What is the time complexity of insertion sort in the worst case scenario?
Answer: The time complexity of insertion sort in the worst case scenario is O(n^2).

2. How does Insertion Sort algorithm work?
Answer: Insertion sort works by iterating over an array of elements and inserting each element into its correct position in a sorted sub-array.

3. Does Insertion Sort algorithm require extra space for sorting?
Answer: No, insertion sort doesn't require extra space for sorting because it works in-place.

4. What is the best case time complexity of Insertion Sort algorithm?
Answer: The best case time complexity of insertion sort algorithm is O(n), when the array is already sorted.

5. How does Insertion Sort algorithm compare to other sorting algorithms in terms of efficiency?
Answer: In general, insertion sort is less efficient than other sorting algorithms like merge sort or quicksort, but it can be faster for smaller arrays or for arrays that are already partially sorted.
