1. What is the difference between a comparison-based sorting algorithm and a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm?
Answer: A comparison-based sorting algorithm compares elements to each other to determine their relative order, while a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm uses other criteria to sort elements, such as their hash value or their position in a data structure.

2. What is the worst-case time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm, and why is it considered inefficient for large data sets?
Answer: The worst-case time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements to be sorted. Bubble sort is considered inefficient for large data sets because it requires multiple passes through the data to fully sort it, which can take a long time.

3. What is the best-case time complexity of the merge sort algorithm, and why is it considered a "divide-and-conquer" algorithm?
Answer: The best-case time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements to be sorted. Merge sort is considered a "divide-and-conquer" algorithm because it breaks down a large problem into smaller sub-problems, sorts these sub-problems recursively, and then merges the sorted sub-problems together to form a complete solution.

4. What is an example of a stable sorting algorithm, and why is stability important?
Answer: Insertion sort is an example of a stable sorting algorithm because it maintains the relative order of equal elements. Stability is important because it ensures that if two elements are equal, their original order will be preserved in the sorted output.

5. What is the difference between an in-place sorting algorithm and an out-of-place sorting algorithm, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
Answer: An in-place sorting algorithm sorts the elements of the input array in place, without using any additional memory. An out-of-place sorting algorithm creates a new array to store the sorted elements, and then copies them back into the input array. The advantage of in-place sorting is that it uses less memory, while the advantage of out-of-place sorting is that it can be easier to implement and can handle larger data sets. However, out-of-place sorting can be slower due to the additional memory operations.
