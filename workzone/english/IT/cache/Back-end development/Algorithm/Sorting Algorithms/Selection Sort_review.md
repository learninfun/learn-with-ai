1. What is the time complexity of selection sort and why?

Answer: The time complexity of selection sort is O(n^2) because it involves two nested loops that iterate over the entire array.

2. How does selection sort work?

Answer: Selection sort works by selecting the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array and swapping it with the first element. It then moves on to the second element and selects the smallest element in the remaining unsorted portion, swapping it with the second element. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

3. What is the space complexity of selection sort and why?

Answer: The space complexity of selection sort is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of additional space to store the index of the minimum element and the value being swapped.

4. Can selection sort be used for sorting lists?

Answer: Yes, selection sort can be used for sorting lists, but it may not be the most efficient sorting algorithm for large lists. Its time complexity is O(n^2), which means it can become slow as the size of the list grows.

5. How does selection sort compare to other sorting algorithms like merge sort and quicksort?

Answer: Selection sort is less efficient than algorithms like merge sort and quicksort because its time complexity is O(n^2). However, it can be useful for small lists or arrays with few elements. It is also a simple algorithm to implement and understand, making it a good starting point for learning about sorting.
