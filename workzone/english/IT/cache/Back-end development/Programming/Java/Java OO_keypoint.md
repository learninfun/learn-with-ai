1. Object-oriented programming (OOP) - Java is an Object-oriented programming language that allows developers to create modular programs using classes and objects.

2. Inheritance - Java supports inheritance, allowing developers to create subclasses that inherit properties and methods from their superclasses.

3. Encapsulation - Java uses encapsulation to protect data from unauthorized access by hiding the implementation details of a class.

4. Polymorphism - Java supports polymorphism, providing the ability for objects to take on multiple forms based on their context.

5. Abstraction - Java uses abstraction to create simple, easy-to-use interfaces that hide complex underlying code.

6. Class - A fundamental concept in Java, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It describes the properties and behavior of objects instantiated from it.

7. Object - An instance of a class, an object has properties and behaviors defined by its class.

8. Method - A block of code that performs a specific task, a method is a behavior of a class.

9. Instance Variable - A variable defined within a class, an instance variable is instantiated with each object created from the class.

10. Access Modifier - A keyword in Java that determines the level of access to class fields, methods, and constructors. The four access modifiers in Java are private, protected, public, and package-private.
