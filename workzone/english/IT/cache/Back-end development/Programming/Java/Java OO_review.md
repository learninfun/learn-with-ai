1. What is polymorphism in Java?

A: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In Java, polymorphism allows an object to be treated as an instance of its class or as an instance of any of its subclasses.

2. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface in Java?

A: An abstract class can contain method implementations, while an interface cannot. An abstract class also allows for only partial implementation of a class, while an interface requires that all methods defined in the interface be implemented in any class that implements the interface.

3. What is the purpose of the 'this' keyword in Java?

A: The 'this' keyword is used to refer to the current object instance within a class. It can be used to access instance variables or call other methods within the class.

4. What is the difference between a private and protected access modifier in Java?

A: A private access modifier restricts a class member to only be accessible within the class in which it is declared. A protected access modifier allows class members to be accessible within the class and its subclasses.

5. What is an abstract method in Java?

A: An abstract method is a method that does not have an implementation within its class. Abstract methods are declared using the 'abstract' keyword and must be implemented by any subclass that extends the abstract class.
