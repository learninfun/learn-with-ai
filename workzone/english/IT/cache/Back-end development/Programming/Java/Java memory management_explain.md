Java memory management is a process by which the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) manages the memory used by Java applications. The JVM is responsible for allocating and deallocating memory on the heap, where objects are stored, as well as managing the stack, which contains only method calls and primitive values.

One example of Java memory management is the use of garbage collection. Garbage collection is the process of identifying and removing objects that are no longer being used by an application. The JVM periodically runs a garbage collection algorithm to free up space on the heap for new objects.

For instance, imagine a Java program that creates an array of objects. As the program executes, it creates new objects and adds them to the array. However, if the program stops referencing these objects or if they go out of scope, they become eligible for garbage collection. When the JVM runs the garbage collection algorithm, it identifies these objects and frees up the memory that they were occupying, making it available for new objects to be stored.

In summary, Java memory management is an essential aspect of the Java programming language, as it ensures that applications can efficiently allocate and deallocate memory and run efficiently without memory leaks or excessive resource usage.
