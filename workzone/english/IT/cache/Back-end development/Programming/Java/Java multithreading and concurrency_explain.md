Java multithreading is the ability of Java to execute multiple threads concurrently within a single program. In other words, Java multithreading allows a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

Concurrency, on the other hand, is the ability of a program to execute several tasks concurrently without any specific order. Java concurrency uses mutual exclusion and synchronization mechanisms to manage access to shared resources throughout the program.

For example, let's say we have two methods, Method1 and Method2, that take a long time to execute. Instead of executing them one by one, we can make them execute concurrently using multithreading.

To implement this, we can create two threads, each of which will execute one of the methods. The threads can be created by extending the Thread class or by implementing the Runnable interface. We can then start each thread using the start() method.

Here's some sample code that demonstrates this:

class MyThread1 extends Thread {
  public void run() {
    // Execute Method1
  }
}

class MyThread2 extends Thread {
  public void run() {
    // Execute Method2
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create two threads
    MyThread1 thread1 = new MyThread1();
    MyThread2 thread2 = new MyThread2();
    
    // Start the threads
    thread1.start();
    thread2.start();
    
    // Wait for the threads to finish
    try {
      thread1.join();
      thread2.join();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
    
    // Program continues when all threads finish
  }
}

In this example, both Method1 and Method2 are executed concurrently using two threads, thread1 and thread2. The join() method is used to make sure that the program waits for both threads to finish before continuing.
