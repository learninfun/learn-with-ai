Java generics is a language feature that enables the creation of classes, interfaces, and methods that work with different types, which are specified at compile time. It is a way of allowing developers to write reusable and type-safe code.

Java generics are defined using angle brackets <>, which encapsulate a type parameter. For example, a generic class to represent a box that can hold any type of object would be defined as follows:

```
public class Box<T> {
    private T item;

    public void put(T item) {
        this.item = item;
    }

    public T get() {
        return item;
    }
}
```

In this example, the type parameter T can be any type, and the variables and methods in the class can work with any type of object that is specified at the time of instantiation.

Using this class, we can create instances of the Box class that are specific to a particular type:

```
Box<String> stringBox = new Box<>();
stringBox.put("Hello World!");
String message = stringBox.get(); // "Hello World!"

Box<Integer> integerBox = new Box<>();
integerBox.put(42);
int value = integerBox.get(); // 42
```

In this way, Java generics enable developers to write reusable and type-safe code, reducing the likelihood of errors and making the code more robust and easier to maintain.
