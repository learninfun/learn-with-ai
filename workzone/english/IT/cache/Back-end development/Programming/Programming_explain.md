Programming refers to the process of writing code in a programming language that is understandable by a computer. It involves creating a set of instructions that can be interpreted by a computer to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. These instructions can be executed to create software, applications, or even games.

For example, consider a program that calculates the area of a square. The program will take the length of one side of the square as input and use a formula (side * side) to calculate the area. The program will then display the result on the screen. This program would involve creating a set of instructions using a programming language like Python or Java that would be executed by a computer to perform the calculations and display the result.
