1. What is the Interpreter Pattern?
Answer: The Interpreter Pattern is a design pattern that defines a language grammar and interprets it using a specific syntax tree to evaluate expressions.

2. What are the key components of the Interpreter pattern?
Answer: The key components of the Interpreter Pattern include the Context, Terminal Expressions, and Non-terminal Expressions. 

3. What is the purpose of the Context in the Interpreter Pattern?
Answer: The Context contains all of the data required for the interpretation process, including the input to be parsed and the output of the evaluation.

4. How do Non-terminal Expressions differ from Terminal Expressions in the Interpreter Pattern?
Answer: Non-terminal expressions are composed of multiple terminal expressions and other non-terminal expressions. Terminal expressions, on the other hand, represent the lowest level of the syntax tree and are used to perform actual evaluations.

5. What are some examples of software applications that can benefit from implementing the Interpreter Pattern?
Answer: Applications that involve parsing and interpreting custom input expressions or programming languages can benefit from using the Interpreter Pattern. Examples include compilers, search engines, and rule-based systems.
