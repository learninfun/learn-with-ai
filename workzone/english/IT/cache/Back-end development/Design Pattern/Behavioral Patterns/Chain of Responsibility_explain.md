Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object in a system to pass requests that it cannot handle to another object until the request is handled or rejected. This pattern decouples the sender of the request from the receiver, allowing multiple objects to handle the request.

For example, consider a system that processes customer complaints. The complaints can range from minor issues like incorrect billing to major issues like product defects. In a Chain of Responsibility pattern, the system can be designed to pass the complaint to different departments or individuals based on its severity.

If a complaint is minor, it can be handled by customer service representatives. If the complaint is more serious, it can be passed to a specialist for that particular product or service. If the complaint is still not resolved, it can be escalated to a senior manager or even the CEO.

In this way, the Chain of Responsibility pattern allows the system to handle complaints efficiently by routing them to the appropriate department or individual. It also allows for a clear escalation path, ensuring that complaints are resolved in a timely and appropriate manner.
