1. What is the Command Pattern?
Ans: The Command Pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for the parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing or logging of requests, and support for undoable operations.

2. How does the Command Pattern work?
Ans: The Command Pattern works by decoupling the object that issues a request (the client) from the object that performs the request (the receiver). This is achieved through the use of a command object that contains all the necessary information to perform the request, such as a reference to the receiver and the method to call.

3. What are the key components of the Command Pattern?
Ans: The key components of the Command Pattern are the client, the receiver, and the command. The client creates the command and specifies its receiver, which will execute the command. The receiver contains the business logic for the command, while the command contains the instruction to carry out the specific operation.

4. What are the benefits of using the Command Pattern?
Ans: The benefits of using the Command Pattern include increased modularity, improved flexibility and extensibility, and better separation of concerns. The pattern also allows for the implementation of advanced features such as undo/redo functionality and queuing.

5. Can the Command Pattern be used in conjunction with other patterns?
Ans: Yes, the Command Pattern can be used in conjunction with other patterns such as the Composite Pattern, the Iterator Pattern, and the Observer Pattern. These patterns can be used to implement more complex functionality and to create more advanced user interfaces.
