1. What is the Template Method Pattern?
Answer: The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, allowing sub-classes to provide specific implementations of certain steps of the algorithm.

2. What are the components of the Template Method Pattern?
Answer: The components of the Template Method Pattern are the abstract base class (which contains the algorithm skeleton), concrete sub-classes (which provide the specific implementations of certain steps), and template method (which is the method in the base class that defines the algorithm skeleton).

3. How does the Template Method Pattern eliminate duplicate code?
Answer: The Template Method Pattern eliminates duplicate code by allowing the base class to define the skeleton of the algorithm and by delegating the implementation of certain steps to the sub-classes. This means that the common code is only written once in the base class, while the specific variations are implemented in the sub-classes.

4. What are the benefits of using the Template Method Pattern?
Answer: The benefits of using the Template Method Pattern include code reusability, reduced maintenance costs, improved scalability, and increased flexibility. It also promotes the separation of concerns, allowing the base class to focus on the overall algorithm structure while the sub-classes focus on the specific variations.

5. When should you use the Template Method Pattern?
Answer: The Template Method Pattern should be used when you have an algorithm that has a fixed structure but varies in certain steps, and when you want to avoid duplicate code and allow for flexible variations. It is especially useful in situations where you need to allow different implementations to work together within a single algorithmic framework.
