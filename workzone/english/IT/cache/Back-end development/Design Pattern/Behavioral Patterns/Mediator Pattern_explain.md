The Mediator pattern is a design pattern in which an object, known as the mediator, centralizes the communication between other objects, called colleagues, without them having direct knowledge of one another. 

The mediator pattern aims to reduce the complexity of the communication between the objects; the colleagues communicate indirectly, through the mediator object. As a result, the object is made easier to maintain and less coupled. 

For example, consider a dialogue box displaying the temperature values of different cities. In this case, the object (the dialogue box) can act as a mediator between the colleagues (different temperature displays). Whenever a new city's temperature is selected, the temperature display of that city needs to be updated in the dialogue box, the mediator thus handles this communication for the temperature displays, as they do not have to communicate independently about such updates.

In the mediator pattern, the mediator acts as an intermediary that manages the communication between the colleagues. It simplifies the communication between the objects by centralizing it, making it an efficient and effective form of communication.
