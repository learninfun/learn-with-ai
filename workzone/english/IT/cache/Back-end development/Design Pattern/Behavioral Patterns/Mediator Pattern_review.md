1. What is the Mediator Pattern and when is it used?
Answer: The Mediator Pattern is a design pattern that promotes loose coupling between objects by allowing them to interact through a mediator. It is used when a group of objects communicate with each other in a complex way that would be difficult to manage without a mediator.

2. How do objects communicate with each other in the Mediator Pattern?
Answer: In the Mediator Pattern, objects communicate through a mediator. Rather than sending messages directly to each other, objects send messages to the mediator, which then relays the messages to the appropriate object.

3. What are some advantages of using the Mediator Pattern?
Answer: The Mediator Pattern promotes loose coupling between objects, which makes it easier to modify or extend the system. It also simplifies the communication between objects, as they only need to interact with the mediator rather than each other.

4. What is the difference between the Mediator Pattern and the Observer Pattern?
Answer: The Mediator Pattern is used when a group of objects need to communicate with each other, while the Observer Pattern is used when one or more objects need to be notified of changes in the state of another object.

5. Can the Mediator Pattern be used in conjunction with other design patterns?
Answer: Yes, the Mediator Pattern can be used in conjunction with other design patterns. For example, it is often used in conjunction with the Factory Method Pattern to manage the creation of objects within a system.
