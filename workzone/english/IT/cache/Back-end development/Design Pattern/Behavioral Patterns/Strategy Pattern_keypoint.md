1. Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows for selecting an algorithm at runtime.
2. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates them in separate classes, and makes them interchangeable.
3. It allows for modularity and flexibility in object-oriented programming.
4. It enables clients to choose from different algorithms in a straightforward and intuitive manner.
5. It separates the use of an algorithm from the implementation details of the algorithm, promoting clean code.
6. It supports the Open-Closed Principle, which enables adding new algorithms without modifying the existing code.
7. Some of the use cases for the Strategy pattern include sorting, encryption, compression, and search algorithms.
