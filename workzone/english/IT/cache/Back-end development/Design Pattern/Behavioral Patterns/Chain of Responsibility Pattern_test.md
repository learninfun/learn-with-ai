1. Q: What is the Chain of Responsibility Pattern?
   A: The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers, each of which can either handle the request or pass it on to the next handler in the chain.

2. Q. What is the purpose of using Chain of Responsibility Pattern?
   A. The purpose of using Chain of Responsibility Pattern is to decouple senders and receivers of a request, and to give multiple objects an opportunity to handle the request.

3. Q: How does the Chain of Responsibility handle a request?
   A: When a request is received, the first handler in the chain checks whether it can handle the request. If it can handle the request, it does so and the request is completed. If it can't handle the request, it passes the request on to the next handler in the chain. This process is repeated until a handler can handle the request or until the end of the chain is reached.

4. Q: What are the advantages of using the Chain of Responsibility Pattern?
   A: The advantages of using the Chain of Responsibility Pattern are:
   - Decouples the sender and receiver of a request
   - Allows multiple objects to handle the request
   - Provides flexibility in assigning responsibilities
   - Reduces coupling between classes

5. Q: Can the Chain of Responsibility Pattern be used to implement error handling in an application?
   A: Yes, the Chain of Responsibility Pattern can be used to implement error handling in an application. Each handler in the chain can be responsible for handling a specific type of error, and can either handle the error or pass it on to the next handler in the chain. This allows for more flexibility in error handling and can prevent errors from crashing the application.
