1. What is the purpose of the observer pattern?
Answer: The observer pattern is used to maintain consistency between related objects by establishing a one-to-many relationship between them. This allows modifications made to one object to automatically update all other dependent objects.

2. What is the difference between the observer pattern and the pub-sub pattern?
Answer: While both design patterns enable communication between objects, the observer pattern has a fixed relationship between the observer and the observed, whereas a pub-sub pattern allows for multiple publishers and multiple subscribers.

3. What is the role of the subject in the observer pattern?
Answer: The subject is the object that is being observed and sends notifications to its observers whenever there are changes in its state.

4. How do observers register their interest in receiving updates from the subject in the observer pattern?
Answer: Observers typically register themselves with the subject by implementing an interface or abstract class and subscribing to the subject's list of observers. When the subject's state changes, it will notify all registered observers.

5. In what scenarios is the observer pattern particularly useful?
Answer: The observer pattern is particularly useful when there is a one-to-many relationship between objects, when objects need to be updated when events occur, and when you want to decouple objects to reduce tight coupling and improve maintainability. Additionally, it can be used in situations where multiple companies or software components need to interact directly to ensure consistency.
