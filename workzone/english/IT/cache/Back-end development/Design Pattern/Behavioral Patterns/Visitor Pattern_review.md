1. What is the Visitor Pattern in software engineering?
Answer: The Visitor Pattern is a design pattern used in object-oriented programming where a set of operations can be defined on an object hierarchy without modifying the objects themselves.

2. How does the Visitor Pattern work?
Answer: The Visitor Pattern works by separating the algorithm from the objects on which it operates. It defines a set of operations (visitors) that can be applied to an object hierarchy. The objects accept a visitor, which then performs the appropriate operation on the object.

3. What are the advantages of using the Visitor Pattern?
Answer: The Visitor Pattern provides a way to define new operations on an object hierarchy without modifying the objects themselves. It also allows for the separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend the code.

4. What are some examples of when to use the Visitor Pattern?
Answer: The Visitor Pattern can be used in a variety of scenarios, such as when working with code that needs to perform different operations on various object types, or when adding new operations to an object hierarchy becomes difficult or impractical.

5. How does the Visitor Pattern relate to other design patterns?
Answer: The Visitor Pattern is often used in conjunction with other design patterns, such as the Composite Pattern, to provide additional flexibility and functionality. It may also be used with the Interpreter Pattern to provide a way to evaluate expressions without modifying the expression tree.
