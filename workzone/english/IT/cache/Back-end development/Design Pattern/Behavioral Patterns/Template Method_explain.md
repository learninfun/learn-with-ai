Template Method is a design pattern that defines the basic steps of an algorithm, allowing subclasses to override specific steps without changing the overall algorithm structure.

The Template Method pattern consists of a base class that defines the overall algorithm structure through a series of abstract methods or concrete base methods. These methods can then be overridden by subclasses to provide specific implementations without affecting the overall algorithm.

For example, consider a class called "Pizza" that represents a pizza order. The template method for making a pizza might be as follows:

1. Prepare dough
2. Add sauce
3. Add cheese
4. Add toppings
5. Bake

The "prepare dough", "add sauce", "add cheese", and "bake" methods could be implemented in the base Pizza class, while "add toppings" could be abstract or even implemented as a default method that takes no action. Subclasses of Pizza such as "PepperoniPizza" and "VegetarianPizza" can then override the "add toppings" method to implement their specific toppings, without affecting the overall algorithm for making a pizza.
