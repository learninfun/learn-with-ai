1) What is the Iterator Pattern?
Answer: The Iterator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

2) What are the two basic components of the Iterator Pattern?
Answer: The two basic components of the Iterator Pattern are the Iterator interface and the ConcreteIterator class.

3) How does the Iterator Pattern help in simplifying client code?
Answer: The Iterator Pattern simplifies client code by providing a standard way to access elements of a collection while hiding its implementation details. It also avoids the need for clients to know the specific data structure and enables them to iterate over a collection in different ways.

4) Can the Iterator Pattern be used to traverse non-linear data structures?
Answer: No, the Iterator Pattern is designed to traverse linear data structures like arrays, lists, and trees. For non-linear structures like graphs, other patterns like Visitor or Composite are more suitable.

5) What is the difference between an external and an internal iterator in the Iterator Pattern?
Answer: An external iterator is controlled by the client code, which calls the iterator's methods to move through the collection. In contrast, an internal iterator is controlled by the collection itself, which defines a traversal strategy and applies it to each element.
