A visitor is someone who arrives at a place, website, or event for the purpose of experiencing it. They can be tourists, customers, users, guests, or any individual who enters a particular location or interface to fulfill a specific objective.

For example, let's say John is a tourist visiting New York City for the first time. He plans to visit popular landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty, Central Park, and the Empire State Building. In this case, John is a visitor to New York City as he is there to explore and experience the city's attractions. Similarly, if someone visits a website to buy a product, they are also considered a visitor to that website.
