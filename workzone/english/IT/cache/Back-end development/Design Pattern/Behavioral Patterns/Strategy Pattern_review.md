1. What is the main purpose of using the Strategy Pattern?
Answer: The Strategy Pattern is used to allow the behavior of an object to be changed at runtime.

2. How is the Strategy Pattern implemented in code?
Answer: The Strategy Pattern is implemented by creating a set of classes that implement a common interface and encapsulate a specific behavior. The client code then selects the desired behavior by passing the appropriate strategy object to the consuming object.

3. What are some advantages of using the Strategy Pattern?
Answer: Some advantages of using the Strategy Pattern include increased flexibility, improved maintainability, and reduced code duplication.

4. How does the Strategy Pattern differ from the Template Method Pattern?
Answer: The Strategy Pattern allows for interchangeable behavior, while the Template Method Pattern defines a set of steps that cannot be changed but can be customized by subclasses.

5. How can the Strategy Pattern be used to implement a sorting algorithm?
Answer: The Strategy Pattern can be used by creating a set of strategy classes that represent different sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort, quick sort). The consuming object could then select the desired algorithm at runtime and use the appropriate strategy object to perform the sort.
