1. What is the Mediator Pattern and what problem does it solve?
Answer: The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows for decoupling of objects by introducing a mediator to coordinate interactions between them. It solves the problem of complex communication between objects, reducing dependencies and making it easier to maintain and modify the system.

2. Can you explain the role of the Mediator in this pattern?
Answer: The Mediator acts as a central hub or communication channel between the objects that are participating in the interaction. It receives requests from objects and routes them to the appropriate receiver or chains them together to achieve the desired result.

3. How does Mediator differ from other design patterns like Observer or Command?
Answer: Mediator differs from Observer in that the former focuses on coordinating the communication between related objects while the latter focuses on minimizing coupling between sender and receiver by introducing an intermediary. Mediator differs from Command in that the former specifies the interactions between participating objects while the latter defines the request and its response in a single object.

4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Mediator Pattern?
Answer: The advantages of Mediator are that it provides a centralized control over the interactions, reducing coupling between objects and making the code easier to test, modify and maintain. The disadvantages are that it can lead to increased complexity and can result in less efficient code due to the additional overhead of coordination.

5. Can you provide an example of how Mediator Pattern can be applied in real-world scenarios?
Answer: Mediator can be applied in scenarios like airline traffic control systems, where a central mediator coordinates the communication between aircraft, airports and air traffic controllers. Similarly, in a complex e-commerce website, a mediator can be used to coordinate interactions between the shopping cart, payment gateway, shipping provider and customer support services.
