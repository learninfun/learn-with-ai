1. What is the State pattern used for?
Answer: The State pattern is used when an object needs to change its behavior based on its internal state.

2. How does the State pattern work?
Answer: The State pattern involves creating a set of state objects that encapsulate the different behaviors of the object. The object then delegates to the state objects to determine its behavior.

3. What are the benefits of using the State pattern?
Answer: The State pattern allows for cleaner code by separating the behavior of an object from its state. It also provides a flexible way to add new behaviors to an object.

4. Can the State pattern be combined with other design patterns?
Answer: Yes, the State pattern can be combined with other design patterns such as the Strategy pattern, which is used to define a family of algorithms.

5. What is the difference between the State and Strategy patterns?
Answer: The State pattern is used to change an object's behavior based on its internal state, while the Strategy pattern is used to define a family of algorithms and choose the appropriate one at runtime.
