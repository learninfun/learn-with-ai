1. What is the Singleton pattern and when would you use it?
Answer: The Singleton pattern is a creational pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. You would use it when you need to ensure that only one instance of a class is ever created and you want a global point of access to it.

2. What is the Builder pattern and when would you use it?
Answer: The Builder pattern is a creational pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations. You would use it when you need to create complex objects that are composed of smaller objects that need to be created in a specific order.

3. What is the Factory Method pattern and when would you use it?
Answer: The Factory Method pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. You would use it when you have a superclass or interface that defines a common set of methods, but subclasses need to implement those methods differently.

4. What is the Abstract Factory pattern and when would you use it?
Answer: The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. You would use it when you need to create objects that belong to a particular group or family and you want to ensure that those objects are compatible with each other.

5. What is the Prototype pattern and when would you use it?
Answer: The Prototype pattern is a creational pattern that allows you to create new objects by cloning existing ones, without specifying their concrete classes. You would use it when you need to create new objects that are similar to existing ones, but with some variations, and you want to avoid the cost of creating those objects from scratch.
