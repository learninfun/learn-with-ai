1. What is the main purpose of the Builder pattern?
Answer: The main purpose of the Builder pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation.

2. How does the Builder pattern differ from the abstract factory pattern?
Answer: The Builder pattern is used to create complex objects step by step, while the abstract factory pattern is used to create families of related objects.

3. What are the advantages of using the Builder pattern?
Answer: The advantages of using the Builder pattern include improved maintainability, more readable code, and the ability to create different variations of the same object.

4. When should you use the Builder pattern in your software design?
Answer: You should use the Builder pattern when you need to create objects that have complex configurations or variations, or when you want to separate the construction of objects from their representation.

5. Can you implement the Builder pattern without using a separate Builder class?
Answer: Yes, you can implement the Builder pattern using a fluent interface or method chaining, but it can make the code more complex and harder to maintain over time.
