1. What is the Prototype Pattern?
Answer: The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows objects to be created by cloning existing objects, rather than creating new objects from scratch.

2. What are the advantages of using the Prototype Pattern?
Answer: The Prototype Pattern can improve performance by avoiding the need to instantiate new objects from scratch. It can also simplify object creation by allowing objects to be created dynamically at runtime.

3. How does the Prototype Pattern work?
Answer: The Prototype Pattern involves creating a prototype object, which serves as a template for creating new objects. The prototype object is then cloned to create new objects with identical properties and behaviors.

4. What is the difference between shallow cloning and deep cloning in the Prototype Pattern?
Answer: Shallow cloning creates a new object with all the properties of the original object, but any objects referenced by the original object are shared between the two objects. Deep cloning creates a new object with all the properties of the original object, including any objects referenced by the original object, so that the two objects are completely independent of each other.

5. When should the Prototype Pattern be used?
Answer: The Prototype Pattern should be used when object creation is expensive or complex, and when you need to create many similar objects with minor variations in their properties or behavior.
