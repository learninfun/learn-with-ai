1. What is the Bridge Pattern in software design?
Answer: Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that separates the abstraction from its implementation by creating two separate abstraction and implementation hierarchies.

2. What are the main components of the Bridge Pattern?
Answer: The main components of the Bridge Pattern are Abstraction, Implementer, Refined Abstraction, and Concrete Implementer.

3. What is the advantage of using the Bridge Pattern?
Answer: The main advantage of using the Bridge Pattern is that it allows the abstraction and implementation to vary independently, reducing the tight coupling between them and making the system more flexible and easy to maintain or modify.

4. Can multiple implementations be used with a single abstraction in the Bridge Pattern?
Answer: Yes, multiple implementations can be used with a single abstraction in the Bridge Pattern, which makes it highly adaptable to changes in the system requirements.

5. How does the Bridge Pattern differ from the Adapter Pattern?
Answer: The Bridge Pattern focuses on separating the abstraction from its implementation, while the Adapter Pattern focuses on adapting one interface to another. Additionally, the Bridge Pattern allows for multiple implementations, while the Adapter Pattern only adapts one interface to another.
