1. What is the Decorator Pattern and how is it used?
Answer: The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to dynamically add behaviors to an object at runtime, by wrapping it in a decorator object that has the same interface as the original object.

2. What are the benefits of using the Decorator Pattern?
Answer: By using the Decorator Pattern, you can add new behaviors to an object without modifying its original code. This allows for greater flexibility and modularity in your software design, and can save you time and effort in the long run.

3. Can the Decorator Pattern be used to replace Inheritance?
Answer: Yes, the Decorator Pattern is often used as an alternative to Inheritance, especially when you want to add functionality to an object without creating a new subclass or modifying the existing code. This makes your code more modular and easier to maintain in the long run.

4. What is the difference between the Decorator Pattern and the Adapter Pattern?
Answer: The Decorator Pattern and the Adapter Pattern are both structural design patterns that involve wrapping one object with another. However, the main difference between them is that the Adapter Pattern is used to make incompatible interfaces compatible, while the Decorator Pattern is used to add new functionality to an existing object.

5. Can the Decorator Pattern be used to remove behavior from an object?
Answer: No, the Decorator Pattern is used to add new behavior to an object, not remove it. If you want to remove behavior from an object, you may need to modify the original code or create a new subclass that omits the unwanted behavior.
