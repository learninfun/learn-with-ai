Bridge is a networking device that connects two different networks together and enables them to communicate with each other. It operates on the data link layer of the OSI model and uses MAC addresses to forward data packets between networks. 

For example, consider two LANs (Local Area Networks) in different buildings of an organization. The LANs are connected via bridges. The bridge receives data packets, checks the MAC address of the destination device, and forwards the packets to the correct network. This allows devices on both LANs to communicate with each other as if they were on the same network. 

Bridges are also used in wireless networks to extend the coverage area or to connect wired and wireless networks. They can also help in reducing network congestion and improving network performance by filtering and forwarding only relevant data.
