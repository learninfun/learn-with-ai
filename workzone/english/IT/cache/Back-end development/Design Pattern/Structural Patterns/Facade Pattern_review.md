1. What is Facade Pattern?
Answer: Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

2. How is Facade Pattern implemented in software development?
Answer: Facade Pattern is implemented by creating a new class that acts as an interface to existing complex subsystem classes.

3. What are the benefits of using Facade Pattern?
Answer: The benefits of using Facade Pattern include simplified interface to complex subsystems, improved code readability, and reduced coupling between the client code and the subsystems.

4. How does Facade Pattern differ from Adapter Pattern?
Answer: Facade Pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, while Adapter Pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together.

5. What are some real-world examples of Facade Pattern?
Answer: Some real-world examples of Facade Pattern include user interfaces for complex systems, such as graphical user interfaces for operating systems or applications. It can also be used in web development to simplify interactions with external APIs.
