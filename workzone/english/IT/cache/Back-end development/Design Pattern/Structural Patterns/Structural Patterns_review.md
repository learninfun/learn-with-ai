4. What is the purpose of the Facade pattern?
Answer: The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex system, making it easier to use and reducing the amount of code required to interact with the system.

5. What is the difference between the Composite and Decorator patterns?
Answer: The Composite pattern allows objects to be structured into a tree-like hierarchy, while the Decorator pattern focuses on adding functionality to individual objects without modifying the original structure.
