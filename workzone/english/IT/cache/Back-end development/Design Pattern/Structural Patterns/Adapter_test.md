1) What is an adapter in programming?
Answer: An adapter is a design pattern that allows incompatible classes to work together by converting the interface of one class into the interface expected by the clients of another class.

2) What is the purpose of an adapter pattern?
Answer: The purpose of an adapter pattern is to facilitate communication between incompatible interfaces or classes by creating a bridge between them.

3) What are some common use cases for an adapter pattern?
Answer: Some common use cases for an adapter pattern include integrating legacy systems with new systems, translating data between different formats, and encapsulating third-party libraries for easier integration.

4) How does the adapter pattern differ from other design patterns?
Answer: The adapter pattern differs from other design patterns such as the decorator pattern in that it specifically deals with the problem of adapting incompatible interfaces, rather than adding new functionality to an existing class.

5) Can an adapter pattern be used for both classes and interfaces?
Answer: Yes, an adapter pattern can be used for both classes and interfaces, as it is primarily concerned with creating a bridge between two incompatible entities, regardless of their type.
