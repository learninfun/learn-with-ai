1. What is the Composite Pattern? 
Answer: The Composite Pattern is a design pattern that allows you to treat groups of objects the same way as individual objects by creating a tree-like structure where both individual objects and composite objects are treated in a uniform way. 

2. What are the two main components of the Composite Pattern? 
Answer: The two main components of the Composite Pattern are the component interface and the composite class. 

3. Can a composite object contain other composite objects? 
Answer: Yes, a composite object can contain other composite objects as well as individual objects. 

4. How do you access individual objects in a composite structure? 
Answer: You can access individual objects in a composite structure by using the same methods and interface that you use to access composite objects. 

5. What are some benefits of using the Composite Pattern? 
Answer: Some benefits of using the Composite Pattern include simplifying the design of complex object structures, making it easy to add and remove objects from the structure, and making the code more flexible and scalable.
