1. Proxy pattern acts as a surrogate for another object to control access to it.
2. It is used to provide a representative object that can handle calls made to the original object from a client.
3. The proxy forwards requests to the real object and can perform additional tasks before or after passing on the requests.
4. The pattern can be used to implement system security, caching, lazy loading, and remote access by passively intercepting and modifying incoming requests.
5. The pattern separates the concerns of the client from the implementation details of the object being accessed.
6. The types of proxy pattern include remote proxy, virtual proxy, protection proxy, cache proxy, and smart proxy.
7. The design of the proxy should ensure compatibility and transparency with the original object's interface.
8. The proxy should not introduce new dependencies, headaches, or performance penalties for the client or real object.
