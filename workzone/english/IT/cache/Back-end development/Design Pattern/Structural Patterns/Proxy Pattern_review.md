1. What is the Proxy Pattern?

2. What are the three main types of proxies in the Proxy Pattern?
Answer: The three main types of proxies in the Proxy Pattern are virtual proxies, remote proxies, and protection proxies.

3. What is the role of a virtual proxy?
Answer: A virtual proxy is used when creating an expensive or complex object in order to defer its creation until it is actually needed. The virtual proxy acts as a stand-in for the real object until it is needed.

4. How does a remote proxy work?
Answer: A remote proxy is used to represent a remote object that may be located on a separate machine or network. The proxy acts as a liaison between the client and the remote object, handling tasks such as serialization and deserialization of data.

5. What is the purpose of a protection proxy?
Answer: A protection proxy is used to control access to an object by enforcing access restrictions. The proxy acts as a gatekeeper, only allowing authorized clients to access the object and blocking unauthorized clients.
