1. Decorator is a design pattern that allows objects to be dynamically decorated with new behaviors or functionalities without modifying the original object.

2. It involves creating a decorator class that wraps the original object and adds new functionalities to it using inheritance.

3. Decorator follows the principle of Open-Closed-Principle(OPC) which says that software entities should be open for extension and closed for modification.

4. It enhances the flexibility and the scalability of the codebase by allowing developers to add or remove functionalities easily.

5. Decorators can be stacked together to create a chain of functionalities, where each decorator adds a unique functionality to the object.

6. The decorator pattern is often used in GUI programming, where it allows developers to add new behaviors to GUI elements dynamically.

7. Decorators are easy to test and can be developed and executed independently of the original object.

8. Decorator pattern is widely used in Java's I/O stream and Java AWT/Swing framework.

9. Some of the other use cases for the decorator pattern include logging, caching, authorization, and authentication. 

10. However, overuse of decorators can lead to complex codebase and reduce the maintainability of the system.
