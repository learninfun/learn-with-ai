1. What is a Decorator design pattern and how does it work? 
Answer: The Decorator design pattern is a structural pattern that lets you add new functionality to an object without modifying its original class. It works by creating a wrapper class that contains the original object and adds new behaviors or properties to it.

2. What are some benefits of using the Decorator pattern? 
Answer: Some benefits of using the Decorator pattern include: 
- Adding new functionality to existing code without modifying it 
- Making it easy to remove or add new decorations as needed 
- Keeping the single responsibility principle intact by separating code into smaller, more manageable classes.

3. What is the difference between a Decorator and an Adapter pattern? 
Answer: The Adapter pattern is used to make incompatible interfaces work together, whereas the Decorator pattern is used to add new functionality to a class without changing its existing behavior. An adapter wraps an object and changes its interface, whereas a decorator wraps an object and adds new behavior.

4. Can a decorator pattern be nested? 
Answer: Yes, a decorator pattern can be nested. This means you can add multiple decorations to a single object, each one building on the previous decoration. However, nesting too many decorators can make the code more complex and difficult to maintain.

5. What is the difference between a concrete decorator and an abstract decorator in the Decorator pattern? 
Answer: A concrete decorator is a specific implementation of the decorator class that adds new functionality to the original object. An abstract decorator is an interface or abstract class that defines the methods that all decorators must implement, and provides a base class that the concrete decorators can inherit from.
