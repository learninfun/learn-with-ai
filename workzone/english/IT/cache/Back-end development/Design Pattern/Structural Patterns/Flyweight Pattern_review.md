1. What is the Flyweight pattern in software design?

Answer: The Flyweight pattern is a structural design pattern that aims to reduce memory usage by sharing commonly used objects between multiple instances.

2. How does the Flyweight pattern differ from the Singleton pattern?

Answer: The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class can be created, while the Flyweight pattern allows multiple instances to be created and shared.

3. In which situations is the Flyweight pattern typically used?

Answer: The Flyweight pattern is typically used in systems where a large number of objects need to be created and memory usage needs to be optimized, such as in games or graphical applications.

4. What are the key elements of the Flyweight pattern?

Answer: The key elements of the Flyweight pattern include a Flyweight interface, a concrete Flyweight class, a Flyweight factory, and a client class that uses the Flyweight objects.

5. What are the benefits of using the Flyweight pattern in software design?

Answer: The benefits of using the Flyweight pattern in software design include reduced memory usage, improved performance, and improved scalability. It also makes it easier to manage large numbers of objects and reduces the amount of code required for object creation.
