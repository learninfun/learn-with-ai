1. What is Adapter pattern in software design?
Answer: Adapter pattern is a design pattern that allows two incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of one object into the interface expected by the clients.

2. What is the difference between class and object adapters?
Answer: Class adapters use multiple inheritance to adapt one interface to another while object adapters use composition to adapt the interface of one object to another.

3. What are the advantages of using adapter pattern?
Answer: Adapter pattern provides flexibility, reusability, and a way to integrate external components into your application without modifying their code.

4. What is the role of Adaptee in Adapter pattern?
Answer: Adaptee is the existing interface that needs to be adapted to work with the client interface. The adapter creates a wrapper around the Adaptee interface to make it compatible with the client's expectations.

5. Can you provide an example of Adapter pattern being used in real-world scenarios?
Answer: A common example of Adapter pattern is the use of third-party libraries in programming languages. When using a library with a different interface than what the client expects, an adapter is used to make the library work with the client's code. Another example is the use of HDMI to VGA adapters, which make devices with HDMI ports compatible with VGA monitors.
