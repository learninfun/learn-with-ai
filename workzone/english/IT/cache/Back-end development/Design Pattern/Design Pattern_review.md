Q1. What is the difference between the Singleton and the Factory design pattern?
A1. The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created, while the Factory pattern abstracts the creation of objects by providing a separate Factory class to manage the creation process.

Q2. Can you explain the Observer design pattern?
A2. The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects, such that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Q3. What is the purpose of the Decorator design pattern?
A3. The Decorator pattern adds additional functionality to an object dynamically, without changing its original structure or behavior.

Q4. What is the difference between the Strategy and the Template Method design patterns?
A4. The Strategy pattern allows you to switch between algorithms or behaviors at runtime, while the Template Method pattern defines a set of steps for a process and allows the subclasses to dictate the specific implementation of those steps.

Q5. What is the benefit of using the Composite design pattern?
A5. The Composite pattern allows you to represent a hierarchy of objects and group them together as a single object. This simplifies your code and makes it easier to add or remove objects from the hierarchy.
