1. What is the time complexity of finding the minimum element in a binary search tree? 
Answer: O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary search tree.

2. What is the difference between a stack and a queue? 
Answer: A stack is a Last-In-First-Out data structure, where the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. A queue is a First-In-First-Out data structure, where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.

3. What is a hashing function used for in data structures? 
Answer: A hashing function is used to convert a given input into a fixed-size representation, called a hash. This hash is used as an index for storing and retrieving data in a hash table, which is a data structure that supports O(1) constant-time retrieval and insertion.

4. What is the purpose of a linked list in data structures? 
Answer: A linked list is a data structure used to store a collection of elements where each element points to the next one in the sequence. Linked lists are useful for dynamic data structures where the size of the collection can change at runtime.

5. What is the difference between an array and a linked list in data structures? 
Answer: An array is a contiguous block of memory used to store a collection of elements of the same data type. An array supports constant-time random access to elements, but its size cannot be changed at runtime. A linked list, on the other hand, is a dynamic data structure where each element points to the next one in the sequence. A linked list can grow or shrink at runtime, but accessing an element in the middle of the list requires traversing the list from the beginning.
