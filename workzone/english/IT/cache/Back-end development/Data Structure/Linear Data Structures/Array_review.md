1) What is the difference between an array and a linked list?
Answer: Arrays allocate a fixed amount of memory for its elements and are accessed by an index, while linked lists dynamically allocate memory for its elements and are accessed by a pointer to the next element.

2) How do you initialize an array in C++?
Answer: You can initialize an array in C++ by specifying the values in curly braces {} separated by commas, like so: int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

3) What is the time complexity to search for an element in an unsorted array?
Answer: The time complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the array, as we may have to search through the entire array to find the element.

4) How do you reverse an array in Java?
Answer: You can reverse an array in Java by swapping the elements starting from the first and last index until you reach the middle index, like so:

int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length / 2; i++) {
   int temp = arr[i];
   arr[i] = arr[arr.length - 1 - i];
   arr[arr.length - 1 - i] = temp;
}

5) What is the difference between a multidimensional array and an array of arrays?
Answer: A multidimensional array is a single block of memory that is indexed by multiple indices, while an array of arrays is a collection of separate arrays that can be different sizes and are accessed using two indices.
