1. A doubly linked list is a type of data structure that consists of nodes linked together in a specific order.

2. Unlike a singly linked list, each node in a doubly linked list has two pointers: one to the next node and one to the previous node.

3. This allows for bi-directional traversals through the list, as well as easier deletion and insertion of nodes.

4. A doubly linked list can be implemented using classes or structures in most programming languages.

5. Some common operations on a doubly linked list include insertion, deletion, and traversal.

6. Insertion and deletion of nodes in a doubly linked list can be faster than in a singly linked list, as only a few pointer updates are necessary.

7. However, doubly linked lists tend to use more memory than singly linked lists because of the extra pointer in each node.

8. Some advanced concepts related to doubly linked lists include circular doubly linked lists and doubly linked lists with a sentinel node.
