1. What is a circular linked list? 
Answer: A circular linked list is a linked list where the last node points to the first node, forming a loop.

2. How do you insert a node at the beginning of a circular linked list? 
Answer: To insert a node at the beginning of a circular linked list, first create a new node and point it to the current head node. Then, update the head pointer to point to the new node. Finally, update the last node pointer to point to the new head node.

3. How do you delete a node from a circular linked list? 
Answer: To delete a node from a circular linked list, first traverse the list and find the node to be deleted. Then, update the previous node's pointer to point to the next node. Finally, update the last node pointer if the deleted node was the last node in the list.

4. Why is a circular linked list useful? 
Answer: A circular linked list is useful because it allows for efficient traversal of the list in both directions. Additionally, it can be used to implement circular buffers or queues.

5. What is the time complexity of inserting or deleting a node from a circular linked list? 
Answer: The time complexity of inserting or deleting a node from a circular linked list is O(1) since it only involves updating the pointers of neighboring nodes.
