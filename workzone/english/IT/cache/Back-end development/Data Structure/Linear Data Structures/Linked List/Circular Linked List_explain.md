A circular linked list is a type of linked list in which the last node of the list points to the first node, creating a circular sequence. This means that traversal of the list can start from any node, but it always ends up back at the same node where it began. 

Example:
Let's take an example of a circular linked list that contains three nodes. The first node contains the data value of "A," the second node contains "B," and the third node contains "C." Each node in the list contains a pointer to the next node, and the last node in the list points back to the first node, forming a circular sequence. 

The structure of the circular linked list will look like:

(A)->(B)->(C)->(A)

Here, the pointer of node "A" points towards node "B," the pointer of "B" points towards "C," and the pointer of "C" points towards "A."

In this manner, the operations of inserting, deleting, or traversing elements in a circular linked list, work similar to that of a normal singly linked list. However, it is important to keep in mind that the linked list is circular, and care must be taken to ensure that the traversal does not enter an infinite loop by going in circles.
