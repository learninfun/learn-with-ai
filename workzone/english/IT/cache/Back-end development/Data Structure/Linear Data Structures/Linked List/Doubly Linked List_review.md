1) What is a doubly linked list?
Answer: A data structure consisting of a series of nodes that are connected through both forward and backward pointers.

2) What is the time complexity of adding a node to the beginning of a doubly linked list?
Answer: O(1) since adding a node to the beginning only requires updating the head pointer.

3) How does a doubly linked list differ from a singly linked list?
Answer: Doubly linked lists have both forward and backward pointers, allowing for traversal in both directions. Singly linked lists only have forward pointers.

4) What is the most efficient way to delete a node from a doubly linked list?
Answer: Removing a node requires updating both the previous and next pointers of the adjacent nodes, which can be done in O(1) time.

5) What are some advantages of using a doubly linked list over a singly linked list?
Answer: Doubly linked lists allow for efficient traversal in both directions, and deleting a node requires only O(1) time complexity. Additionally, searching for a specific node can be done in either direction, improving efficiency in certain use cases.
