1. What is the difference between an array and a linked list?
Answer: An array is a static data structure where the size is fixed at the time of declaration whereas a linked list is a dynamic data structure where size is not fixed and can grow or shrink dynamically.

2. What is the time complexity to search an element in a sorted array?
Answer: The time complexity to search an element in a sorted array is O(log n).

3. What is a stack and what are its basic operations?
Answer: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. The basic operations of a stack are push (to add an element at the top), pop (to remove the top element), and peek (to return the top element).

4. What is a binary search tree and how is it different from a normal binary tree?
Answer: A binary search tree is a binary tree where the left child node contains a value less than the parent node value, and the right child node contains a value greater than the parent node value. In a normal binary tree, there is no such ordering constraint.

5. What is a queue and what are its basic operations?
Answer: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. The basic operations of a queue are enqueue (to add an element at the rear end), dequeue (to remove the front element), and peek (to return the front element without removing it).
