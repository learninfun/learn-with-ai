1. What is a stack in computer science?
Answer: A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

2. What are the two primary operations performed on a stack?
Answer: The two primary operations performed on a stack are push (adding an element to the top of the stack) and pop (removing an element from the top of the stack).

3. What is the maximum number of elements that can be stored in a stack?
Answer: The maximum number of elements that can be stored in a stack depends on the available memory in the system.

4. How can you check if a stack is empty?
Answer: You can check if a stack is empty by checking if the top of the stack is equal to NULL, or by using the function isEmpty().

5. What is a stack overflow?
Answer: A stack overflow occurs when a program attempts to store more data on the stack than it can handle, usually due to insufficient memory or recursive function calls that don't exit properly.
