An array is a type of data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. Each element in the array is accessed using an index, which is an integer value that represents its position within the array. 

Here's an example of an array in JavaScript:

```
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

This array contains 5 elements, each of which is an integer. The first element has an index of 0, the second has an index of 1, and so on. We can access the elements of the array using their indexes, like this:

```
console.log(numbers[0]); // outputs 1
console.log(numbers[2]); // outputs 3
```

We can also change the value of an element in the array by assigning a new value to its index:

```
numbers[3] = 10;
console.log(numbers); // outputs [1, 2, 3, 10, 5]
```

Arrays are commonly used in programming because they provide a convenient way to store and access collections of data.
