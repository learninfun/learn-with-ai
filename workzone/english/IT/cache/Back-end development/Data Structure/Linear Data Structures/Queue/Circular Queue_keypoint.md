1. Circular queue is a data structure that follows the principle of FIFO (First In First Out).
2. It can be visualized as a circular arrangement of elements with a fixed size.
3. Instead of a simple queue, it has two pointers- front and rear- that point to the first and last element of the queue, respectively.
4. When items are added to the queue, they are added to the rear end and when elements are removed, they are removed from the front end.
5. As the queue is circular, when the end is reached, the next element is added at the beginning of the queue, allowing data to be reused in the empty spaces.
6. The circular queue has a fixed capacity, which is defined when it is created. The capacity cannot be changed once created.
7. Circular queues are commonly used in computer science, particularly in computer networks, operating systems, and memory allocation.
8. The implementation of the circular queue operation includes enqueue, dequeue, peek, isFull, and isEmpty.
