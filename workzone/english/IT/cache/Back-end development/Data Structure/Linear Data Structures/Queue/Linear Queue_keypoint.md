1. Linear queue is a type of collection that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added to the queue gets accessed first.

2. It uses an array data structure to store the elements in a sequential manner, and two pointers known as front and rear, to keep track of the elements.

3. The front pointer points to the first element in the queue, while the rear pointer points to the last element that was added.

4. Initially, both pointers are set to -1, indicating that the queue is empty.

5. When an element is added to the queue, it is inserted at the rear end of the queue using the rear pointer, and the rear pointer is incremented by 1.

6. When an element is removed from the queue, the front pointer is incremented by 1, and the corresponding element is deleted from the front end of the queue.

7. Linear queue has a fixed size, and once its capacity is reached, it is said to be full, and no more elements can be added to it.

8. One disadvantage of linear queue is that it suffers from the problem of overflow (when the queue is full) and underflow (when the queue is empty).

9. However, linear queue is a simple and efficient data structure that is widely used in computer programming for implementing various algorithms and applications.
