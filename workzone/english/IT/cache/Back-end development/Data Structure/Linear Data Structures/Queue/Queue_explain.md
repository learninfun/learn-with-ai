A queue is a data structure that stores a collection of elements in a linear order. It has two main operations: enqueue, which adds an element to the back of the queue, and dequeue, which removes an element from the front of the queue. The elements are retrieved from the queue in the order they were added, making it a "first-in, first-out" (FIFO) structure.

A common real-world example of a queue is a line of people waiting to purchase tickets for a movie. The first person to arrive at the ticket counter is the first to be served, and as more people arrive, they join the queue at the back. When the ticket seller is ready to serve the next customer, they remove the first person from the queue and sell them a ticket. The process continues until all the customers have been served.
