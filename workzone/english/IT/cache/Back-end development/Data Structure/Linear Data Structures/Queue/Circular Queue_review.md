1. What is a Circular Queue?
Answer: A Circular Queue is a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and its last element is connected to the first element to form a loop.

2. What is the difference between a normal Queue and a Circular Queue?
Answer: In a normal Queue, the last element is followed by a NULL pointer, whereas in a Circular Queue, the last element is connected to the first element to form a loop.

3. How do we implement a Circular Queue?
Answer: We can implement a Circular Queue using an array or a linked list. In the array implementation, we use two pointers to indicate the front and rear of the queue, and in the linked list implementation, we use a circular linked list to connect the last element to the first element.

4. What is the advantage of using a Circular Queue over a normal Queue?
Answer: Unlike a normal Queue, a Circular Queue does not waste memory space as it reuses the unused space in the queue. Additionally, a Circular Queue offers better performance than a normal Queue, especially when dealing with large datasets.

5. What are the operations supported by a Circular Queue?
Answer: The operations supported by a Circular Queue are enqueue (insertion of element at the rear), dequeue (removal of element from the front), peek (viewing of front element), and isFull (checking if the queue is full) and isEmpty (checking if the queue is empty).
