1) What is a circular queue and how does it differ from a regular queue?
A circular queue is a type of queue data structure where the last element is connected to the first element to create a circular structure. This allows for efficient use of memory and enables the queue to continue functioning even if the size limit has been reached.

2) How are elements added and removed from a circular queue?
Elements are added to the rear of the queue and removed from the front of the queue. When the last element is reached, the pointer wraps around to the first element to continue the circular structure.

3) What is the purpose of a circular queue?
A circular queue is used to efficiently manage a set of data elements that need to be processed in a sequential manner. For example, it may be used in a computer program to buffer incoming data from a network or other source before processing it.

4) Can a circular queue be implemented using an array data structure?
Yes, a circular queue can be implemented using an array data structure. The array is treated as a circular structure and the position of the first and last elements is tracked using pointers.

5) How do you check if a circular queue is empty or full?
To check if a circular queue is empty, you can compare the values of the front and rear pointers. If they are the same, the queue is empty. To check if the queue is full, you can compare the values of the front and rear pointers plus one. If they are the same, the queue is full.
