1. What is a queue data structure?
Answer: A queue is a linear data structure that behaves like a line where the elements are inserted and removed using a First-In-First-Out mechanism.

2. What are the basic operations supported by a queue?
Answer: The basic operations supported by a queue are enqueue (insertion of element to the rear end of the queue) and dequeue (removal of element from the front end of the queue).

3. What is the time complexity of enqueue and dequeue operations in a queue?
Answer: The time complexity of enqueue and dequeue operations in a queue is O(1).

4. What is the difference between a queue and a stack?
Answer: The difference between a queue and a stack is that in a queue, elements are inserted from the rear end and removed from the front end whereas in a stack, elements are inserted and removed from the same end, which is the top.

5. What is meant by the term circular queue?
Answer: A circular queue is a type of queue where the last element of the queue is connected to the first element, forming a circle. This allows for efficient use of the memory allocated to the queue as it eliminates the need for the queue to resize or shift positions.
