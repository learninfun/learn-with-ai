1. What is a non-linear data structure and how is it different from a linear data structure?
A non-linear data structure is a data organization format that does not follow a sequential or linear arrangement of elements, which is the case in linear data structures like arrays, lists, and stacks.

2. Name some examples of non-linear data structures.
Some examples include trees, graphs, heaps, and hash tables.

3. What is the basic unit of a tree data structure?
The basic unit of a tree data structure is a node, which has a value and one or more child nodes connected to it.

4. How is a binary tree different from a general tree?
A binary tree is a specific type of tree structure where each node has at most two child nodes, while a general tree can have any number of child nodes.

5. What is the purpose of a hash table and how is it implemented?
A hash table is a data structure that allows for efficient lookups of values using a key. It achieves this by using a hash function to map the key to an index in an array, where the value associated with that key is stored. The hash function should be designed to minimize the likelihood of key collisions, which occurs when multiple keys map to the same index.
