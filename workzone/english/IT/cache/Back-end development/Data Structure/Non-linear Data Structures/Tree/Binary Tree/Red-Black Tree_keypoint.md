1. A red-black tree is a balanced binary search tree.
2. It has the same performance characteristics as AVL tree.
3. Each node has a color attribute of either red or black.
4. The root node is always black.
5. All leaves are null and black.
6. If a node is red, then both its children are black.
7. Every path from a given node to any of its descendant null leaves contains the same number of black nodes.
8. Insertion and deletion operations maintain the necessary properties of a red-black tree.
9. The worst-case time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion is O(log n) in a red-black tree.
10. Red-black tree is used in many data structures such as TreeMap, TreeSet, etc.
