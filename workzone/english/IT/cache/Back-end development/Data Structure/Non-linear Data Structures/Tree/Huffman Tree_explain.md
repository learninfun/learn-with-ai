Huffman tree, also known as a Huffman coding tree or a minimum-redundancy coding tree, is a binary tree used in data compression where each leaf node represents a character found in the data being compressed. The tree is constructed in a way that assigns shorter codes to frequently occurring characters and longer codes to infrequently occurring characters to create a more efficient encoding.

An example of a Huffman tree is as follows:
 
        A
      /    \
    B        C
   /  \     /   \
  D   E    F    G
 
In this example, A represents a combination of the characters B, C, D, E, F, and G. The edges leading to each child node are assigned a value of either 0 or 1, where 0 represents the left child and 1 represents the right child. The codes for each character are then generated based on the path from the root to the corresponding leaf node. This method of encoding results in a more efficient compression of data compared to other encoding methods, especially for data with highly repetitive patterns.
