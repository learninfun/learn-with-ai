1. What is the maximum number of keys that can be stored in a single node of a B+ tree?
Answer: The maximum number of keys that can be stored in a single node of a B+ tree is defined by the order of the tree, denoted by n. A node can store up to n-1 keys.

2. What is the purpose of separating the leaf nodes from the internal nodes in a B+ tree?
Answer: The separation of leaf nodes and internal nodes in a B+ tree allows for quick searching and retrieval of data, as leaf nodes contain pointers to the actual data records. Separating the leaf nodes also enables efficient disk access since the leaf nodes represent a smaller portion of the overall tree structure.

3. How does a B+ tree maintain balance when new data is added to or removed from the tree?
Answer: B+ trees maintain balance by redistributing data and adjusting the structure of the tree. When a node becomes too full or too empty, its data is redistributed to its siblings or parent nodes. If a redistribution is not possible, the tree structure may be adjusted by splitting or merging nodes to ensure that the tree remains balanced.

4. What is the complexity of searching for a specific record in a B+ tree?
Answer: The complexity of searching for a specific record in a B+ tree is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because the search process is essentially a binary search, where each step reduces the search space by roughly half.

5. How does a B+ tree support range queries?
Answer: B+ trees support range queries by either performing a binary search to locate the starting index of the range and then scanning sequentially until the end of the range is reached, or by using a technique called range splitting. Range splitting involves splitting the range query into several smaller queries that can be performed separately on each node in the tree.
