1. A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as left child and right child.

2. The nodes are arranged in a hierarchical order, with the topmost node being the root node.

3. Each node contains a value or data, and the values of the nodes on the left and right branches satisfy a specific ordering.

4. Binary trees can be of many types, such as balanced, unbalanced, complete, or perfect.

5. In a binary search tree, the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node, while the right subtree contains nodes with values greater than the node.

6. Traversing a binary tree can be done in several ways, including pre-order, in-order, or post-order traversal.

7. Binary trees are frequently used in computer science and programming, for example, to construct efficient searching and sorting algorithms.
