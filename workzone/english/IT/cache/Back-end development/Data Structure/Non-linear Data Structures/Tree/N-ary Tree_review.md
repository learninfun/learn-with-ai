1) What is an N-ary tree?
Answer: An N-ary tree is a tree-like data structure where each node can have at most N children.

2) What is the height of an N-ary tree with N=3 and total number of nodes=13?
Answer: The height of an N-ary tree with N=3 and 13 nodes is 2. 

3) What is the maximum number of nodes in the deepest level of an N-ary tree with N=4 and height=3?
Answer: The maximum number of nodes in the deepest level of an N-ary tree with N=4 and height=3 is 64. 

4) Can an N-ary tree have a cycle?
Answer: No, an N-ary tree cannot have a cycle because there is only one path from the root to any other node in the tree. 

5) How do you calculate the total number of nodes in an N-ary tree?
Answer: The formula for calculating the total number of nodes in an N-ary tree is: N^0 + N^1 + N^2 + ... + N^h, where N is the maximum number of children and h is the height of the tree.
