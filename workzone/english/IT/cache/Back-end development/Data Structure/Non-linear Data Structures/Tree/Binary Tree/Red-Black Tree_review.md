1. What is the maximum height of a Red-Black Tree with n nodes?
Answer: 2log(n+1)

2. What is the time complexity of searching for a value in a Red-Black Tree?
Answer: O(log n)

3. What is the color of the root node in a valid Red-Black Tree?
Answer: Black

4. What is the purpose of the Red-Black Tree's color-folding operation?
Answer: It reduces the number of consecutive red nodes in a branch while maintaining the tree's properties.

5. What is the main advantage of Red-Black Trees over other self-balancing trees, such as AVL Trees?
Answer: Red-Black Trees have better insert and delete operations, with a worst-case time complexity of O(log n), while AVL Trees have a worst-case time complexity of O(log n) for all operations.
