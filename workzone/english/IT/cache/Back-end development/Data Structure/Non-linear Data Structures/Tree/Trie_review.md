1. What is a Trie and what is it commonly used for?
Answer: A Trie (pronounced "try") is a data structure that stores a collection of strings, and it is commonly used for efficient searching and retrieval of information from large datasets.

2. What are some advantages of using a Trie over other data structures?
Answer: Tries have several advantages over other data structures, including fast search and retrieval times, efficient memory usage, and easy scalability.

3. How is a Trie different from a hash table or binary search tree?
Answer: A Trie differs from a hash table and binary search tree in that it stores strings as a sequence of nodes, with each node representing a single character in the string. This allows for fast prefix-based searching and retrieval of information.

4. How does the Trie insertion process work and what is its time complexity?
Answer: The Trie insertion process involves starting at the root node and traversing down the tree to the appropriate leaf node for the new string being inserted. If a prefix of the new string already exists in the tree, then the traversal continues from that point. The time complexity of this operation is O(m), where m is the length of the string being inserted.

5. What are some common applications of Tries in computer science?
Answer: Tries are commonly used in applications such as autocomplete, spell checking, and text mining, as well as in networking and routing protocols to efficiently route packets based on IP addresses.
