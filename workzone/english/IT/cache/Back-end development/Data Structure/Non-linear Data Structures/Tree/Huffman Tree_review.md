1. Q: What is a Huffman tree?
   A: A Huffman tree is a binary tree used in data compression algorithms to efficiently encode characters based on their frequency of occurrence.

2. Q: What is the key idea behind building a Huffman tree?
   A: The key idea is to assign shorter codes to characters that occur more frequently and longer codes to characters that occur less frequently.

3. Q: How is a Huffman tree constructed?
   A: A Huffman tree is constructed by repeatedly merging the two least frequent characters until all characters are merged into a single tree.

4. Q: What is the time complexity of constructing a Huffman tree?
   A: The time complexity is O(n log n), where n is the number of characters in the input.

5. Q: What is the benefit of using a Huffman tree for data compression?
   A: The benefit is that it provides a more efficient method of representing data by using fewer bits for frequently occurring characters, resulting in smaller file sizes and faster data transmission.
