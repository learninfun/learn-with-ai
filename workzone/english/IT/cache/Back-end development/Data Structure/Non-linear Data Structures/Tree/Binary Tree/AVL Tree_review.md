1. Q: What is an AVL Tree? 
A: An AVL Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree, where the heights of the left and right subtrees are kept almost equal for every node.

2. Q: What is the height of an AVL Tree with a single node? 
A: The height of an AVL Tree with a single node is 0, as it has no subtrees.

3. Q: How is AVL Tree different from a regular binary search tree? 
A: AVL Tree is different from a regular binary search tree because it automatically balances itself after every insertion or deletion operation, while in a regular binary search tree, the tree may become degenerate if not balanced properly.

4. Q: What is the worst-case time complexity of searching an AVL Tree with n nodes? 
A: The worst-case time complexity of searching an AVL Tree with n nodes is O(log n), as it is a self-balancing binary search tree.

5. Q: How does AVL Tree ensure that the heights of the subtrees are balanced? 
A: AVL Tree ensures that the heights of the subtrees are balanced by performing rotation operations when a node's balance factor (the difference between the heights of its left and right subtrees) becomes greater than 1 or less than -1, which helps to maintain the almost equal height of left and right subtrees.
