1. Q: What is a B-Tree?
   A: A B-Tree is a data structure that is primarily used for indexing and searching large amounts of data efficiently.

2. Q: What is the purpose of a B-Tree?
   A: The primary purpose of a B-Tree is to provide efficient searching and indexing of large amounts of data, particularly in cases where the data is too large to fit into memory.

3. Q: How does a B-Tree differ from other data structures like binary trees?
   A: A B-Tree differs from binary trees in that it has multiple children per node, whereas binary trees only have two children per node.

4. Q: What is the order of a B-Tree?
   A: The order of a B-Tree is the maximum number of child nodes that any given node can have.

5. Q: How is data inserted into a B-Tree?
   A: Data is inserted into a B-Tree by first searching for the correct location, and then inserting the data into the appropriate leaf node, splitting nodes as necessary to maintain the order of the tree.
