1. What does the term "adjacent" mean in relation to a graph?
Answer: Two vertices are adjacent if they are connected by an edge.

2. What is the shortest path between the vertices A and C in the following graph? 
                  A -- B -- C
                 /      |      \
                D      E       F
Answer: The shortest path between A and C is A -> B -> C.

3. What is the degree of vertex B in the following graph?
                A -- B -- C
                |      |
                D     E
Answer: The degree of vertex B is 3.

4. What is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the following graph so that no adjacent vertices have the same color?
                A -- B -- C
                 \   |   /
                  D  E
Answer: The minimum number of colors needed is 3.

5. Is the following graph connected or disconnected?
                A -- B -- C
                        |
                        D
Answer: The graph is connected.
