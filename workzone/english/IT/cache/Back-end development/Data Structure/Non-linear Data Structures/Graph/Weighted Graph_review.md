1) What is a weighted graph? 
Answer: A weighted graph is a graph in which each edge is assigned a numerical weight or cost.

2) How do you represent a weighted graph in computer science? 
Answer: A weighted graph can be represented using an adjacency matrix or an adjacency list.

3) What is Dijkstra’s algorithm used for in weighted graphs? 
Answer: Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph.

4) What is the minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph? 
Answer: The minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph is the tree that connects all of the vertices with the minimum total weight or cost.

5) What is the time complexity of finding the shortest path in a weighted graph using Dijkstra’s algorithm? 
Answer: The time complexity of finding the shortest path in a weighted graph using Dijkstra’s algorithm is O(E + V log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.
