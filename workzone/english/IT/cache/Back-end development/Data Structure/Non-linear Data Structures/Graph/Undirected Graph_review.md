1. What is an undirected graph?

Answer: An undirected graph is a type of graph in which the edges have no orientation, meaning they do not have a direction.

2. What is the difference between an undirected graph and a directed graph?

Answer: The key difference between an undirected graph and a directed graph is that in a directed graph the edges have a direction, while in an undirected graph the edges have no direction.

3. How do you represent an undirected graph mathematically?

Answer: An undirected graph can be represented mathematically using a set of vertices and a set of edges. The vertices represent the nodes in the graph and the edges represent the connections between those nodes.

4. What is the degree of a vertex in an undirected graph?

Answer: The degree of a vertex in an undirected graph is the number of edges that are connected to that vertex. In other words, it is the number of neighbors that a vertex has.

5. What is a connected component in an undirected graph?

Answer: A connected component in an undirected graph is a subgraph in which every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. This means that there is a path between any two vertices in the connected component.
