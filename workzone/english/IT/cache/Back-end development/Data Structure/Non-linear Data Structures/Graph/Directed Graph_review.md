1. What is a directed graph?
Answer: A directed graph, or digraph, is a graph in which the edges have a directionality or orientation, meaning they point from one vertex to another in a specific direction.

2. What is the difference between a directed graph and an undirected graph?
Answer: The main difference between a directed graph and an undirected graph is that the edges in a directed graph have a direction, whereas edges in an undirected graph do not have a direction.

3. What is an indegree and outdegree in a directed graph?
Answer: In a directed graph, indegree refers to the number of incoming edges to a vertex, while outdegree refers to the number of outgoing edges from a vertex.

4. What is a cycle in a directed graph?
Answer: A cycle in a directed graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex and travels through a series of vertices and edges, where each edge is directed in the same direction.

5. What is an adjacency matrix in a directed graph?
Answer: An adjacency matrix is a matrix used to represent a directed graph, where each row and column represents a vertex, and the entries in the matrix represent the presence or absence of edges between vertices.
