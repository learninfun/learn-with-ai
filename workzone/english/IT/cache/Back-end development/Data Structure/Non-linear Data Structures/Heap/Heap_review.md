1. What is a Heap?
Answer: A Heap is a data structure that is used to structure data in a way that prioritizes elements based on certain criteria.

2. What are the two types of Heaps?
Answer: The two types of Heaps are Max Heap and Min Heap.

3. How is a Max Heap different from a Min Heap?
Answer: In a Max Heap, the parent node is always greater than the child nodes, whereas in a Min Heap, the parent node is always smaller than the child nodes.

4. What is the time complexity for inserting an element in a Heap?
Answer: The time complexity for inserting an element in a Heap is O(log n).

5. How can you implement a Heap using an array?
Answer: A Heap can be implemented using an array by maintaining the Heap Property i.e. the parent element is always greater/smaller than the child elements. The first element of the array is the root element of the Heap. The left child of a node at index i is at index 2i+1, and the right child is at index 2i+2.
