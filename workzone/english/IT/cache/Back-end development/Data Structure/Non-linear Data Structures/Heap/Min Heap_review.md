1. What is a Min Heap?
A Min Heap is a binary tree where the parent node is smaller than its children.

2. What is the time complexity of adding a new element to a Min Heap?
The time complexity of adding a new element to a Min Heap is O(log n).

3. What is the root node of a Min Heap?
The root node of a Min Heap is the smallest element in the heap.

4. How do you delete the minimum element from a Min Heap?
You can delete the minimum element from a Min Heap by replacing it with the last leaf node and then recursively swapping it with its parent until the Min Heap property is restored.

5. What is the space complexity of a Min Heap?
The space complexity of a Min Heap is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the heap.
