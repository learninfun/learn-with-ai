1. What is a Binary Heap?
Answer: Binary Heap is a data structure that is a complete binary tree where all levels are completely filled, except possibly the last level.

2. What is the time complexity of finding the maximum or minimum element in a Binary Heap?
Answer: The time complexity of finding the maximum or minimum element in a Binary Heap is O(1) as it can be easily obtained from the root node.

3. How does a Binary Heap compare to a Binary Search Tree?
Answer: Both Binary Heap and Binary Search Tree are binary trees, but Binary Heap is used for priority queue and sorting applications, while the Binary Search Tree is used for search, insertion and deletion of dat values.

4. Can a Binary Heap have duplicate elements?
Answer: Yes, a Binary Heap can have duplicate elements.

5. What is the process for inserting a new element into a Binary Heap?
Answer: The process for inserting a new element into a Binary Heap is to add the new element at the end of the heap and then bubble up the element by swapping it with its parent until the heap property is maintained.
