1. A Max Heap is a type of binary tree where each parent node is greater than or equal to its child nodes.
2. The highest priority element is always at the top of the heap, which is the root node.
3. The left child of a node is always smaller than its right child.
4. The height of a max heap is always logarithmic with respect to the number of nodes in the tree.
5. A max heap can be efficiently implemented using an array.
6. The time complexity for inserting a new element in a max heap is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the heap.
7. Similarly, the time complexity for deleting the root node (highest priority) is also O(log n).
8. Max heaps are used in many applications, including sorting algorithms like heap sort and priority queues.
