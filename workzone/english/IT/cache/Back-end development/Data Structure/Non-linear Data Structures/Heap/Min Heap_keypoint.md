1. A Min Heap is a complete binary tree where each node has a value smaller than or equal to its children.
2. The root of the Min Heap is always the minimum value of the heap.
3. Operations like insertion, deletion, and retrieval have a time complexity of O(log n) in a Min Heap.
4. A Min Heap can be represented using an array, where the left child of node i is at index 2i+1, and the right child is at index 2i+2.
5. A Min Heap is useful for implementing priority queues and sorting algorithms like heapsort.
6. The Min Heap property ensures that the highest priority item is always at the top of the heap and can be accessed quickly.
7. When the root node is removed from a Min Heap, the next smallest element in the heap takes its place, maintaining the Min Heap property.
