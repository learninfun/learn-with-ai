1. What is Spring Boot and what are its advantages?

Answer: Spring Boot is an open-source framework used to create Spring-based applications quickly and easily. It provides a range of features, such as auto-configuration, which reduces the amount of code developers need to write. Other advantages of Spring Boot include easier deployment, better performance, and improved developer productivity.

2. What is the difference between @Component, @Service, and @Repository annotations in Spring Boot?

Answer: @Component, @Service, and @Repository are all annotations used to define different types of beans in a Spring Boot application. @Component is a general-purpose annotation, while @Service is commonly used for business logic components, and @Repository is used for database operations. However, the functionality of these annotations is similar and they can be used interchangeably.

3. How can you handle exceptions in a Spring Boot application?

Answer: Spring Boot provides several mechanisms for handling exceptions, including using @ExceptionHandler to intercept exceptions, defining a default error page or response for certain HTTP errors, and implementing and registering custom exception handlers. Additionally, Spring Boot also provides the @ControllerAdvice annotation that allows you to define exception handling methods in one central place and reuse them across your application.

4. What is the purpose of the Spring Boot Actuator module?

Answer: The Spring Boot Actuator module provides several production-ready features that can be used to monitor and manage your Spring Boot application, including health endpoints that provide information about the application's health, metrics endpoints that provide information about the application's performance and usage, and management endpoints that allow you to manage and monitor the application at runtime.

5. How can you configure logging in a Spring Boot application?

Answer: Spring Boot uses the Logback framework for logging by default, but it can also be configured to use other logging frameworks such as Log4j or Java Util Logging (JUL). To configure logging, you can add a logging configuration file (e.g., logback.xml) to your application's classpath or configure logging programmatically using the Spring Boot logging API. Additionally, Spring Boot also provides support for log rotation, logging to different appenders, and other advanced features.
