4. Question: What is the difference between a hard link and a symbolic link in Linux? 
Answer: A hard link is a direct reference to a file's inode (a data structure that stores information about a file). Changes to the original file are reflected in all hard links. A symbolic link (also called a "soft" link) is like a shortcut that points to the original file's path. Symbolic links are not affected by changes to the original file.

5. Question: How can you view a list of processes currently running on a Linux system? 
Answer: The command is "ps" (short for process status). "ps aux" will show a detailed list of all processes running on the system, including the user who started the process and the resources it is using.
