1. User authentication - Linux has robust user authentication mechanisms that ensure only authorized users can access the system. 

2. File permissions - Linux uses file permissions and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure that only authorized users and processes can access files and directories. 

3. Firewalls - Linux supports a range of firewalls and network security tools that help to protect against network attacks and intrusions. 

4. Encryption - Linux systems support a range of encryption technologies that can be used to protect sensitive data, including SSH, SSL/TLS, and disk encryption. 

5. System updates - Regular software updates help to protect Linux systems against security vulnerabilities and exploits. 

6. Auditing - Linux includes tools that allow system administrators to monitor, log, and analyze system activity and security events. 

7. Secure boot - Secure boot ensures that the system only boots from trusted sources and that the root file system is protected from unauthorized changes. 

8. Network security - Linux includes built-in support for virtual private networks (VPNs), secure remote access (SSH), and other network security technologies. 

9. Malware detection and removal - Linux includes a range of tools for detecting and removing malware, including antivirus software, rootkit scanners, and intrusion detection systems. 

10. Application security - Application-level security measures, such as sandboxing, mandatory access control (MAC), and stack smashing protection, help to prevent applications from being exploited by attackers.
