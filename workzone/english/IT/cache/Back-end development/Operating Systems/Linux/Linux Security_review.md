1. What is the purpose of SELinux in Linux security?
Answer: SELinux stands for Security-Enhanced Linux and it is a mandatory access control (MAC) mechanism that enforces fine-grained access policies for system resources. It is designed to provide additional layers of security to the Linux operating system by limiting the permissions of users and applications.

2. What is a firewall and how does it improve Linux security?
Answer: A firewall is a tool that allows network traffic to be filtered based on various rules and policies. It helps to block unwanted traffic and prevent attacks against the system. In Linux, firewalls can be implemented using different tools such as iptables, nftables, or firewalld.

3. What are the risks of SSH (Secure Shell) and how can they be mitigated?
Answer: SSH is a secure network protocol used to access remote machines. However, if not configured properly, it can pose security risks such as unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, or man-in-the-middle attacks. Some ways to mitigate these risks include disabling root login, using public-key authentication, and limiting access to trusted IPs.

4. How can you check for vulnerabilities in your Linux system?
Answer: There are several tools available to check for vulnerabilities in Linux such as OpenVAS, Nessus, or Nmap. These tools scan the system and highlight vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers. Regular vulnerability scans can help identify and address potential security issues.

5. What is file system encryption and how does it improve Linux security?
Answer: File system encryption is a technique that encrypts data stored on filesystems and protects it from unauthorized access. In Linux, this can be achieved using tools such as dm-crypt or VeraCrypt. By encrypting sensitive data, file system encryption helps to prevent data theft, even if an attacker gains access to the physical device.
