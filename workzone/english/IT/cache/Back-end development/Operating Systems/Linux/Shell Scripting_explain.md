Shell scripting is the process of writing a series of commands in a file to automate a specific set of tasks in a Unix-based operating system. Typically, a shell scripting language like Bash is used to automate tasks that would otherwise require the manual entry of multiple commands.

Here is an example of a simple shell script:

```
#!/bin/bash

# This is a simple script to print out a list of files in a directory

echo "List of files in the current directory:"
ls
```

This script uses the #! symbol (called a shebang) to indicate that it should be executed by the Bash shell. The comment on the second line describes what the script does, and the echo command prints a message to the console. Finally, the ls command lists all the files in the current directory. When executed, this script will show a list of files in the directory where it was run. 

Shell scripting is a powerful tool for automating repetitive tasks, managing system resources, and performing complex operations in a streamlined manner.
