1. What is a document database?
Answer: A document database is a type of non-relational database that stores data in a semi-structured format, usually in JSON or BSON format.

2. How is querying data different in a document database compared to a relational database?
Answer: In a document database, querying data is typically done using a flexible query language, such as MongoDB's query language, which allows for complex queries with nested data structures. In a relational database, querying data is done using SQL, which requires predefined table structures and joins.

3. What are some advantages of using a document database?
Answer: Some advantages of using a document database include scalability, flexibility, and performance. Document databases can easily handle large amounts of data and are highly scalable, allowing for scaling horizontally across multiple servers. They also offer flexibility in data modeling and can perform complex queries efficiently.

4. What are some common use cases for document databases?
Answer: Document databases are commonly used in applications that require flexible data modeling, such as content management systems, e-commerce platforms, and social media applications. They are also well-suited for real-time analytics and processing of big data.

5. How does data consistency work in a document database?
Answer: In a document database, data consistency is typically maintained at the document level rather than the database level. This means that each document can have unique schema and validation rules, allowing for different levels of consistency. However, document databases do offer features such as transactions and atomic operations to ensure data integrity.
