1) What is the difference between a key-value store and a document-based database in NoSQL?
Answer: A key-value store stores data as a simple key-value pair, while a document-based database stores data as structured documents in a flexible schema.

2) What is sharding in NoSQL databases and why is it important?
Answer: Sharding is the process of horizontally partitioning data across multiple nodes in a distributed system. It is important in NoSQL databases to handle big data and scalability.

3) What is ACID compliance and why do some NoSQL databases not follow it?
Answer: ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) compliance ensures that a transaction is executed completely or not at all. Some NoSQL databases do not follow it because it can limit performance and scalability.

4) What is eventual consistency in NoSQL and why is it a challenge for some applications?
Answer: Eventual consistency is a model where the database updates will be consistent eventually, but not immediately in a distributed system. It can be a challenge for applications that require immediate consistency, such as financial transactions.

5) What are some common examples of NoSQL databases used in the industry?
Answer: MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, Redis, and Amazon DynamoDB are popular examples of NoSQL databases used in the industry.
