1. What is normalization in database design?
Answer: Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce data redundancy and dependencies, resulting in a more efficient and structured database.

2. What is denormalization in database design?
Answer: Denormalization is the process of adding redundant data to a database to improve performance by reducing the number of joins needed in database queries.

3. What are the advantages of normalization?
Answer: Some advantages of normalization include reduced data redundancy, improved data consistency, and better data integrity.

4. What are the disadvantages of normalization?
Answer: Some disadvantages of normalization include increased complexity and overhead, reduced database performance, and difficulty in querying data across tables.

5. When should you consider denormalization in database design?
Answer: Denormalization should be considered when there is a need for faster data retrieval, such as in high-traffic websites or applications with complex queries, and when the data is unlikely to change frequently.
