1) What is query optimization in database management systems?
Answer: Query optimization refers to the process of improving the performance of a database query by identifying the most efficient execution plan for that query.

2) What are some common techniques used in query optimization?
Answer: Common techniques used in query optimization include indexing, table partitioning, parallel processing, and data normalization.

3) How do you measure the performance of a query?
Answer:  Query performance can be measured using metrics such as query execution time, CPU utilization, I/O operations per second, and disk usage.

4) What is the role of the query optimizer in a database management system?
Answer: The query optimizer is responsible for analyzing the structure and content of a database query, and then generating an optimized execution plan that will produce results as quickly and efficiently as possible.

5) How can you improve the performance of slow-running queries?
Answer: To improve the performance of slow-running queries, you can optimize the database schema, add appropriate indexes, use caching or memory structures, and tune system resources such as CPU and memory allocations.
