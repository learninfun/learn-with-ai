1. What is normalization in database design, and why is it important? 
Answer: Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and ensure data consistency. It is important because it can improve data integrity and reduce data storage requirements.

2. What are the different types of relationships that can exist between tables in a database? 
Answer: There are three main types of relationships in database design: one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. A one-to-one relationship exists when each record in one table is associated with only one record in the other table. A one-to-many relationship exists when each record in one table is associated with multiple records in the other table. A many-to-many relationship exists when multiple records in one table are associated with multiple records in the other table.

3. What is an index in a database, and how can it improve database performance? 
Answer: An index is a data structure that allows for faster searching of data in a database. It can improve database performance by reducing the amount of time it takes to search for specific data in a large database. This is because an index keeps track of the location of data in the database, allowing queries to quickly locate the desired data.

4. What is a primary key in a database, and why is it important? 
Answer: A primary key is a field or set of fields in a table that uniquely identifies each record in the table. It is important because it ensures that each record is unique and can be easily referenced by other tables in the database. Additionally, a primary key can be used as a reference point for creating relationships between tables.

5. What is a foreign key in a database, and how is it used to create relationships between tables? 
Answer: A foreign key is a field in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to create relationships between tables by allowing records in one table to reference records in another table. This creates a relationship between the tables, which can be used to access related data from one table to another.
