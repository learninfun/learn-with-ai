A Wide Area Network (WAN) is a type of network that spans a large geographic area, such as a country or even multiple countries. It typically uses telecommunications infrastructure such as telephone lines, fiber-optic cables, or satellite links to connect devices or networks that are far apart from each other. The primary function of a WAN is to allow businesses, organizations, and individuals to communicate with each other over long distances, share resources, and access the Internet.

An example of WAN is the Internet itself, which is the largest global WAN in existence. Other examples of WANs include corporate networks that connect multiple offices or locations across a city or country, or cloud-based networks that allow users to access data and applications from anywhere in the world. Mobile networks like LTE, 3G or 4G can also be considered as a WAN as they use radio waves to communicate over large geographical distances.
