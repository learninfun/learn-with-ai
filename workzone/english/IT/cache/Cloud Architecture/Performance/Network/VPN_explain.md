A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a secure connection or tunnel between two devices, usually a computer or smartphone, and a remote server. This connection is encrypted and allows users to access the internet securely and anonymously. It enables users to browse privately, bypass geo-restrictions, and protect sensitive data from hackers.

An example of VPN is the one used by employees working remotely or traveling. They can connect to their company's network through a VPN to access company files, data, and resources securely. The communication data is encrypted, and employees can work from any location, minimizing the risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, or cyber attacks.
