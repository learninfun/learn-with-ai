CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It is a group of servers distributed across the globe that work together to deliver content more efficiently to users. When a client makes a request for content, such as a webpage or a video, the content is served from the server closest to the client, rather than from the origin server. This reduces the time and latency involved in loading the content, resulting in faster page load times and a better user experience.

For example, if a website is hosted on a server in the United States and a user in India tries to access it, the content has to travel a long distance, resulting in longer load times. However, if the website uses a CDN, the user's request would be routed to a server that is located closer to them in India, resulting in faster load times. One popular CDN is Cloudflare, which is used by many websites to improve their content delivery speed.
