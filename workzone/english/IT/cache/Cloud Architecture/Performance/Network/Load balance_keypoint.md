1. The load balancer distributes requests evenly across multiple servers.
2. It helps prevent overloaded servers and ensures high availability and reliability.
3. Load balancing can be performed at different levels of the network stack, such as application layer, transport layer, and network layer.
4. There are various load balancing algorithms, such as round-robin, least connections, and IP hash.
5. Load balancers can be hardware-based or software-based.
6. They can also provide additional features such as SSL termination, content caching, and DDoS protection.
7. Load balancing can improve website or application performance by reducing response time and increasing throughput.
8. Load balancing can also help with scaling as it allows for the addition or removal of servers without disruption to the end-users.
