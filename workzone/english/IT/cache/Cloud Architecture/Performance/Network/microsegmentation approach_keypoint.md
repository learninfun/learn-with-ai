1. Individual network segments: Microsegmentation involves breaking down a network into smaller and more specific segments, often on an individual machine or application level.

2. Enhanced security: This approach helps enhance security by limiting the spread of cyber threats or attacks across a network. Each segment has its own security policies.

3. Better visibility: Microsegmentation allows for better visibility into network traffic and patterns.

4. Granular access control: By limiting access to specific parts of the network, microsegmentation enables granular access control.

5. Reduced attack surface: By isolating workloads and applications, microsegmentation reduces the attack surface for cyber criminals.

6. Improved compliance: Microsegmentation helps improve compliance with regulations by enforcing strict controls on data access.

7. Scalability: This approach can be implemented at scale due to software-defined networking (SDN) that allows for programmatic enforcement and can be automated.

8. Can support hybrid cloud: Microsegmentation can support hybrid cloud environments by providing security policies that apply to both on-premises and cloud-based resources.
