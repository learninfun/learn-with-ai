Microsegmentation is a security approach that involves dividing a network into smaller subnetworks or “microsegments” to improve security and reduce the likelihood of a successful cyber attack. This approach enables organizations to enforce stricter security policies and individualized access control for each microsegment, which helps limit lateral movement by attackers within a network.

For instance, consider an e-commerce website that has various sections such as the homepage, product catalog, shopping cart, and payment gateway. With microsegmentation, the network can be divided into subnetworks or "microsegments" such that each section can be isolated and protected separately. This means that if an attacker gains access to the payment gateway, they cannot move laterally and access the product catalog, homepage, or other sections. Each microsegment can have its own firewall, security policies, and access control mechanisms, making it harder for attackers to escalate privileges and take over the entire network. 

In summary, microsegmentation is a security approach that helps organizations mitigate risks and keep networks safe through dividing networks into smaller microsegments. It provides increased visibility, control, and segmentation, which can minimize the attack surface and prevent the spread of malware and unauthorized access.
