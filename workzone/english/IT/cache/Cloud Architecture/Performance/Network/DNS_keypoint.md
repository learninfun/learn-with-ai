1. DNS stands for Domain Name System.

2. DNS translates human-readable domain names (such as example.com) into IP addresses (such as 93.184.216.34) that computers and servers use to identify each other on the internet.

3. DNS is a distributed system consisting of multiple servers that work together to resolve domain name queries.

4. The DNS hierarchy is organized into zones, with each zone responsible for managing and resolving queries for its subdomains.

5. DNS records contain information such as IP addresses, mail servers, and other information about a domain.

6. DNS resolution can be performed recursively (by querying other DNS servers) or iteratively (by querying only the authoritative server).

7. DNS security is important as it can be susceptible to attacks and misuse.

8. DNS offers several different record types, including A records, MX records, CNAME records, and TXT records.
