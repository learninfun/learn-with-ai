DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is a system that translates domain names into IP addresses, which computer networks use to identify and communicate with each other over the internet. DNS servers maintain a database of domain names and IP addresses, and when a user types a domain name into their web browser, the DNS server checks its database to find the corresponding IP address and connects the user's computer to that address.

For example, if a user types "www.google.com" into their web browser, the DNS server will look up the IP address associated with that domain name (which is currently 172.217.164.174) and connect the user's computer to that address. Without DNS, users would have to remember the IP addresses of every website they wanted to visit, which would be difficult and impractical given the vast number of websites on the internet.
