1. What is DNS and how does it work?
Answer: DNS (Domain Name System) is a system used to translate human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers can understand. When a user types a domain name into a web browser, a query is sent to a DNS server to find the corresponding IP address. The DNS server then responds with the IP address, allowing the web browser to establish a connection to the website.

2. What is a DNS recursive query?
Answer: A DNS recursive query is a request sent to a DNS server that asks it to locate the IP address for a specific domain name. The server will first check its own cache to see if it has the answer stored locally. If not, it will query other DNS servers in a hierarchical manner until the IP address is found and returned.

3. What is a DNS zone file?
Answer: A DNS zone file is a text file that contains information about a specific domain and its associated resource records. It includes the domain name, the IP addresses of any servers hosting the domain, and other information such as mail server settings and DNS record types.

4. What is a DNS resolver?
Answer: A DNS resolver is a component of the DNS system that is responsible for receiving DNS queries from a client and resolving them by sending requests to DNS servers to find the IP address of the domain being queried. The resolver caches the results of its queries to improve performance and reduce network traffic.

5. How can DNS be vulnerable to attacks?
Answer: DNS can be vulnerable to various attacks, such as DNS spoofing, DNS cache poisoning, and DNS amplification attacks. These attacks can result in the redirection of traffic to malicious websites, the manipulation of DNS records, and the flooding of networks with large amounts of DNS traffic to overwhelm servers. To mitigate these risks, DNS security protocols and tools such as DNSSEC and firewalls should be used.
