Load balancing refers to the process of distributing the workload across multiple servers or resources to improve the overall performance, reliability, and availability of a system. It ensures that all requests are processed efficiently and that no server is overwhelmed with requests, which would cause the system to slow down or crash.

For instance, suppose you run an e-commerce website that receives a large volume of traffic during peak hours. To handle the traffic efficiently, you set up a load balancer that routes incoming requests to multiple web servers. The load balancer might use a round-robin algorithm to distribute requests evenly across servers or use an intelligent algorithm to route requests based on server capacity or geographic location.

The load balancer ensures that all servers are used effectively, so no server is overworked, and your website remains fast and responsive, even during peak traffic. If one server fails or goes down, the load balancer can automatically redirect traffic to other servers, so there is minimal disruption to your customers. Load balancing thus plays a vital role in maintaining the performance, reliability, and availability of web-based applications.
