1) What is a CDN and how does it work?
Answer: A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a network of servers that help deliver content (such as images or videos) to users more quickly by caching (storing) the content closer to the user and delivering it from the closest server.

2) What are the benefits of using a CDN?
Answer: A CDN can improve website speed, reduce server load, increase website availability, and provide better user experiences by delivering content faster and more reliably.

3) How does a CDN choose which server to deliver content from?
Answer: A CDN uses a process called "edge caching" to store content on servers that are geographically closer to users. This helps reduce the distance and time it takes for content to travel to the user's device.

4) Can a CDN protect against DDoS attacks?
Answer: Yes, a CDN can protect against DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks by using advanced security measures such as web application firewalls and traffic filtering.
