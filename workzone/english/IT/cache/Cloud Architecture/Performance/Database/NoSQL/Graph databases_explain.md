Graph databases are databases that store data and their relationships in a graph structure. In a graph structure, data is represented as nodes (vertices) and the relationships between them as edges (lines connecting the vertices). The data in a graph database can be easily queried and visualized, making it ideal for applications that require faster and more accurate results.

An example of a graph database is Neo4j, which is one of the most popular graph databases used today. Neo4j stores data as nodes and relationships, with each node representing an entity (e.g., a person, a company) and each relationship representing how those entities are related (e.g., an employee works for a company). The relationships between nodes can be queried, and complex queries can be executed quickly and efficiently. Neo4j is used in applications such as recommendation engines, social network analysis, and fraud detection.
