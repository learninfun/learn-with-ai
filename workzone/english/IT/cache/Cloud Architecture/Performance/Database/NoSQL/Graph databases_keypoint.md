1. Graph databases store data in a graph structure, consisting of nodes and edges.
2. Nodes represent entities and edges represent the relationships between them.
3. Graph databases use a flexible schema, allowing for easy modification and evolution of data models.
4. Graph databases are designed to handle complex and interconnected data, allowing for powerful querying capabilities.
5. Graph databases are optimized for graph traversal operations, making them well-suited for applications such as social networks, recommendation engines, and fraud detection systems.
6. Graph databases are typically faster and more efficient than relational databases when dealing with complex queries and large data sets.
