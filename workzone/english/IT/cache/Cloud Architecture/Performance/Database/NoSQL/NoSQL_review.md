1. What is NoSQL and how does it differ from traditional relational databases? 
Answer: NoSQL stands for "not only SQL" and is a type of database management system that does not rely on the traditional table-based structure of relational databases. Unlike relational databases, NoSQL databases are highly scalable, flexible and can handle unstructured data such as text, images, and videos more efficiently.

2. What are some types of NoSQL databases and what are their use cases? 
Answer: There are several types of NoSQL databases, including document-based, key-value, column-family, and graph databases. A document-based database is used for storing and managing semi-structured data such as XML, JSON or BSON documents. A key-value database is used for fast retrieval of data using a key-value pair. A column-family database is used for managing large amounts of structured or semi-structured data in tables. A graph database is used for managing relationships between data points.

3. What are the advantages of using NoSQL over traditional relational databases? 
Answer: Some advantages of using NoSQL databases include better scalability, faster performance, flexibility in handling unstructured data, lower cost and complexity, and a more agile development process.

4. How does sharding work in NoSQL databases? 
Answer: Sharding is a way to horizontally partition data across different servers in a NoSQL database. By splitting data into smaller, manageable chunks, each shard can be stored and managed more efficiently, leading to better scalability, faster performance, and improved fault tolerance.

5. What are some common NoSQL data modeling techniques? 
Answer: Some common NoSQL data modeling techniques include denormalization (combining related data into a single document), embedding (nesting documents within other documents), and aggregation (grouping and summarizing data). These techniques can help improve performance and simplify queries within NoSQL databases.
