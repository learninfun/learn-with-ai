Columnar databases are a type of database management system that store data in columns rather than rows. This means that each column contains data from a particular type of field, such as addresses, dates, or names. The advantage of this type of database is that it allows for faster querying and analysis of large data sets, as only the columns needed for a particular query need to be accessed, rather than the entire row.

An example of a columnar database is Apache Cassandra. Cassandra is a distributed database that is designed to handle large data sets across a distributed set of servers. With Cassandra, data is stored in columns, making it easy to query and analyze large datasets. This makes it a popular choice for applications that require high performance and scalability, such as social networks, online gaming platforms, and financial services applications. In addition, Cassandra is open source, which means that it is available to developers for free and can be customized to meet specific needs.
