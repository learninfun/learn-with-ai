1. Data is stored in columns rather than rows, which allows for efficient querying and analysis of specific attributes.
2. A columnar database is suitable for handling large amounts of data and high query volumes.
3. Data compression techniques are used to reduce storage space and decrease the amount of I/O operations required.
4. Parallel processing allows for fast querying, even when dealing with large datasets.
5. Columnar databases are optimized for read-heavy workloads, making them ideal for analytical applications.
6. Data does not need to be transformed or aggregated before storing it in a columnar database, which makes it easy to perform complex analyses.
7. Columnar databases provide high availability and scalability for large-scale applications.
8. They can be integrated with various BI and analytics tools, making it easier to visualize and analyze data.
9. Queries can be optimized using indexing and partitioning techniques.
10. Columnar databases are often used for data warehousing, business intelligence, and OLAP applications.
