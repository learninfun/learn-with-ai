1. A Key Value Database (KVD) is a type of NoSQL database that stores data as key-value pairs.

2. In KVDs, data is accessed and managed primarily using unique keys assigned to each data value.

3. The keys are used to retrieve or update the corresponding values stored in the database.

4. KVDs are designed for high performance, scalability, and ease of use.

5. Key-value databases are schema-less, meaning data can be stored in any format without the need for a predefined schema.

6. KVDs can store both structured and unstructured data.

7. Some popular examples of Key Value Databases include Apache Cassandra, Riak, and Amazon DynamoDB.

8. KVDs are commonly used for managing large-scale distributed applications, caching, messaging systems, and online gaming.

9. KVDs are typically faster than traditional relational databases since they do not require complex queries or schema lookups. 

10. KVDs are highly scalable and can be expanded horizontally by adding new nodes as the data volume grows.
