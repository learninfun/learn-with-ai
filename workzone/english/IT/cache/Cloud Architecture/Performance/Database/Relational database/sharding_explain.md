Sharding is a method of database partitioning that separates large databases into smaller, faster, and more manageable parts called shards. Each shard is a self-contained database that contains only a portion of the full data set. By distributing data across multiple shards, queries can be executed faster as the database can be split across multiple servers or nodes, reducing the load on any single machine.

For example, imagine a cloud-based e-commerce platform with millions of users and huge amounts of data. Rather than storing all user data on a single server, sharding would allow the platform to partition the user data into smaller, more manageable parts stored on multiple servers. This would allow the system to manage the large amount of data while still providing efficient responses to user queries. Sharding would also provide better scalability for future growth as the platform can easily add new servers or nodes to handle additional data.
