Read Replica is a database replica that is created from a master database to provide a read-only copy of the data. It is used to distribute read traffic to multiple copies of a database, thereby reducing the load on the master database and improving the performance of the application. Read replicas are used in read-heavy applications where the majority of the queries are reads.

For example, Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers an Amazon RDS service that allows users to create a read replica of their master database. The read replica is available for read-only queries and is updated asynchronously from the master database. This allows applications to scale their read capacity without adding additional load on the master database. Additionally, AWS RDS uses Multi-AZ deployments to ensure high availability for read replicas in case of a fault in the primary database.
