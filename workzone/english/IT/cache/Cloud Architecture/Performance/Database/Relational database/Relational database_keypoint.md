1. Relational database management systems (RDBMS) are used to store and manage data in a structured way.
2. Data is stored in tables, with each table containing rows and columns.
3. The columns in a table represent attributes or characteristics of the data or entities being represented, and the rows represent individual instances or records.
4. Relationships can be established between tables using foreign keys, which allow for data to be linked and queried across multiple tables.
5. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a common language used to interact with relational databases, allowing users to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data.
6. Relational databases can be scaled vertically (adding hardware resources to a single database) or horizontally (distributing data across multiple databases).
7. Relational databases provide a high level of consistency and data integrity, preventing data from being duplicated or inconsistent across different records.
8. Relational databases are widely used across various industries, including finance, healthcare, and government.
9. While more complex than other database models, relational databases enable efficient data management and retrieval and are well-suited to handle large amounts of structured data.
