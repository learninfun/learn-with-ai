1. Sharding is a database scaling technique that involves partitioning data into smaller, more manageable fragments or shards.
2. Each shard is stored on a separate server or node, allowing for horizontal scaling.
3. Sharding can improve performance and reduce latency by allowing queries to be processed in parallel.
4. Sharding can also increase availability and fault tolerance by distributing data across multiple nodes.
5. However, sharding requires careful planning and implementation to ensure that data is properly partitioned and queries are sent to the appropriate shard.
6. Sharding can also lead to increased complexity and maintenance costs, as well as potential data consistency issues.
