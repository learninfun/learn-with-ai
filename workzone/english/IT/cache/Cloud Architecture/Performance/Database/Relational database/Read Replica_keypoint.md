1. Read replicas provide scalability and improve the read performance of an application.

2. A read replica is a copy of a source database instance that is created automatically and synchronously updated with the source.

3. Read replicas can be used in read-heavy workloads, analytics or reporting, and reducing the load on the source database instance.

4. With read replicas, database administrators can improve the availability and reliability of their systems by replicating data to different regions or availability zones.

5. Read replicas can be managed through various services such as Amazon RDS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.

6. Read replicas can also be configured to use different instance types or databases to optimize performance and cost.

7. Read replicas can be promoted to become the new source database instance in case of failures or planned maintenance.

8. Consistency and durability of data are maintained between read replica and source instance through synchronous replication.

9. Additional read replicas can be added to scale read workloads further, and they are useful in scaling up data access for high numbers of concurrent users.

10. While read replicas improve read performance, they do not create a high-availability solution on their own â€“ additional measures need to be taken in ensuring a high availability system.
