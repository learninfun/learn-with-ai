1. What is sharding in database architecture?
Answer: Sharding is a technique used in database architecture where data is horizontally divided into smaller partitions or shards to distribute the load and increase scalability.

2. What is the main benefit of sharding in databases?
Answer: The main benefit of sharding is increased database scalability, as it allows for handling larger volumes of data and increased performance.

3. What are some potential challenges of implementing sharding in a database?
Answer: Some potential challenges of implementing sharding include maintaining data consistency across shards, managing shard distribution and load balancing, and dealing with potential network and hardware failures.

4. How can data be partitioned in sharding?
Answer: Data can be partitioned in sharding based on different criteria, such as geographic location, user ID, or data type.

5. What are some common sharding techniques?
Answer: Some common sharding techniques include range sharding, where data is partitioned based on its value range; hash sharding, where data is partitioned based on a hash function; and modulus sharding, where data is partitioned based on a modulus function.
