1. What is a primary key in a relational database?
Answer: A primary key is a unique identifier for a row of data in a table, used to ensure that each row can be uniquely identified and accessed.

2. How is a foreign key used in a relational database?
Answer: A foreign key is used to establish a relationship between two tables in a relational database. It refers to the primary key of another table and is used to ensure referential integrity and maintain consistency of data across tables.

3. What is normalization in a relational database?
Answer: Normalization is the process of organizing data in a relational database by breaking it down into smaller, related tables, in order to minimize redundancy and improve efficiency of data retrieval and manipulation.

4. What is a join in a relational database?
Answer: A join is an operation that combines data from two or more tables in a relational database into a single result set. It is typically used to retrieve data that is spread across multiple tables based on some common attribute.

5. What is the difference between a clustered and a non-clustered index in a relational database?
Answer: A clustered index is an index in which the physical order of data in the table is organized based on the index key, whereas a non-clustered index is an index in which the physical order of data in the table is not dependent on the index key. Clustering the data can improve performance for certain types of queries, while non-clustered indexes are typically used for smaller tables or to index specific columns within larger tables.
