OLAP stands for Online Analytical Processing, which is a technology used for analyzing and processing large volumes of data to support business intelligence. OLAP enables users to query and view data in different dimensions, such as time, location, or product, providing a multi-dimensional view of data that allows users to explore data using different perspectives.

An example of an OLAP analysis is a sales report for a retail chain, which includes different dimensions like time, location, product, and customer. By slicing and dicing the data using different dimensions, the user can get insights into the sales performance of different product categories, store locations, and customer segments over time. For example, the user can identify which products are selling more at a particular store location or which customer segment is contributing high sales. With OLAP, the user can view the data in multiple dimensions and uncover hidden relationships and opportunities that are not visible in traditional reports.
