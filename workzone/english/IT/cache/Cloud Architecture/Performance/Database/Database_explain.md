A database is a collection of data that is organized in a specific way, making it easy to access, manage, and update. It typically consists of tables that contain related information and can be searched and sorted to find specific data. One example of a database is an online retail store's inventory system, where each product is listed in a table with information such as price, quantity, and description. This data can be easily accessed and updated, allowing the store to keep accurate and up-to-date records of their inventory.
