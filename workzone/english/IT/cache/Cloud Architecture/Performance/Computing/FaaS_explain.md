FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) is a cloud computing model that allows developers to write and execute specific code functions in response to events or triggers, without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. FaaS providers take care of server management, maintenance, and scaling. 

An example of FaaS is AWS Lambda, a service provided by Amazon Web Services. Developers can use Lambda to create code functions that can be triggered by various events, such as changes in data stored in Amazon S3, new messages in an Amazon SQS queue or an HTTP request. When a Lambda function is triggered by an event, AWS automatically scales the necessary resources and executes the function. Developers only pay for the execution time and resources consumed by the function. Lambda supports several programming languages such as Node.js, Python, Java, C#, and Go.
