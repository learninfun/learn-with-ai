Hyper-V is a virtualization technology developed by Microsoft that allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical host machine. It is a part of the Windows Server operating system and provides a virtualization platform for running different operating systems and applications in isolated environments.

An example of Hyper-V usage is a company that needs to run multiple operating systems or applications on separate virtual machines. Using Hyper-V, they can create and manage these virtual machines on a single physical server, reducing hardware costs and simplifying management. They can also configure and manage the virtual machines to meet specific business requirements and allocate resources such as memory, CPU, and storage. This ensures critical applications always have access to the resources they need, ultimately improving performance and reliability.
