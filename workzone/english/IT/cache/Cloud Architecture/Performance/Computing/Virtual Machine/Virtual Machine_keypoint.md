2. They allow users to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine simultaneously.
3. Virtual machines are isolated from the host system, which provides added security and reliability.
4. They use a hypervisor, which manages the allocation of hardware resources between the virtual machines and the host system.
5. Virtual machines allow for easy migration of operating systems and applications between different physical machines.
6. They allow IT professionals to test and deploy new applications and upgrades without affecting the production environment.
7. Virtual machines can be easily created and managed using virtualization software.
8. They provide a cost-effective way to run multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine.
