A virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system that allows multiple operating systems (OS) or applications to run simultaneously on a single physical machine. VMs are isolated from each other, providing the ability to work on different environments without interfering with each other.

A typical example of a virtual machine is the Oracle VM VirtualBox. The software is a free desktop virtualization application that allows users to create and run multiple virtual machines on their desktop or laptop computers. Users can install different operating systems, including Windows, Linux, macOS, and Solaris, and run them simultaneously with their host OS, allowing for easy testing, development, and deployment of software across different environments without the need for multiple physical machines.
