1. What is Docker, and how does it work?

A: Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to package their applications into containers. These containers can then be moved between different environments, such as development, testing, and production, without any changes to the underlying infrastructure. Docker achieves this by using a lightweight, standalone runtime environment that can be deployed on any operating system.

2. How is Docker different from virtual machines?

A: Virtual machines (VMs) create entire virtualized environments with their own operating systems, while Docker uses containerization to isolate applications from one another without the need for multiple operating systems. This means that Docker containers are much faster and use fewer resources than VMs, making them ideal for deploying applications at scale.

3. What is a Dockerfile, and how is it used?

A: A Dockerfile is a script that contains instructions for building a Docker image. These instructions include things like which operating system to use, which packages to install, and how to configure the environment. Once a Dockerfile is created, it can be used to build an image, which can then be used to create Docker containers.

4. What is Docker Compose, and how does it work?

A: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows developers to define the services that make up their application, along with their dependencies and configurations, in a single YAML file. Docker Compose then creates and starts all the necessary containers, ensuring that they are connected and configured correctly.

5. How does Docker Swarm enable container orchestration?

A: Docker Swarm is a native clustering and orchestration solution for Docker containers. It allows developers to deploy and manage a cluster of Docker nodes as a single virtual system, with automatic load balancing, scaling, and failover. Docker Swarm uses a declarative approach, where developers define the desired state of their system, and the Swarm manager ensures that the actual state matches the desired state.
