Docker is a platform or tool that is used to develop, deploy, and run applications by creating containers. Containers allow developers to package an application with all of its dependencies and requirements, making it easy to move between development and production environments. Docker is an open-source platform, and it is becoming increasingly popular for use in DevOps and cloud computing environments.

Here's an example of how Docker can work:

Suppose a development team is building a web application, which uses a database and a web server. Rather than having to set up these components on each individual development machine, the team can use Docker to create containers that include the database, web server, and application, all packaged together. Everyone on the team can then use these containers, allowing them to work on the same application with the same environments, regardless of their individual setup. When it's time to move the application to production, the same containers can be used, ensuring that the application will run smoothly in that environment.
