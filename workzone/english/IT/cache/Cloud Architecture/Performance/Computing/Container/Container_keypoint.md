ization:

1. Containerization involves encapsulating applications and their dependencies within a container that can be easily deployed and run on any server or platform.

2. Containers are lightweight, portable, and can be easily moved between different environments, making it easier to manage applications at scale.

3. Containers operate in a sandboxed environment, which means that any changes made to the container are isolated and will not affect the host system or other containers on the same host.

4. Containers use container images, which are pre-built packages that include all the necessary components and dependencies needed for an application to run.

5. Container orchestrators, such as Kubernetes, help to manage and scale containerized applications across multiple hosts and environments.

6. Containerization allows for faster and more efficient application deployment, as well as better resource utilization and improved security.
