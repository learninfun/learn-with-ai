PaaS stands for Platform as a Service. It is a cloud computing model that allows developers to deploy and manage applications without having to worry about the infrastructure or platform on which the applications are running. PaaS providers offer a preconfigured environment that includes an operating system, programming language runtime, and database, as well as tools and frameworks for building and deploying applications. This allows developers to focus on writing code and building their applications, while leaving the underlying infrastructure and platform to the PaaS provider.

Example: Heroku is a popular PaaS provider that allows developers to deploy and manage their applications in the cloud. Heroku supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, such as Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Python, and Java, and provides tools for version control, database management, and scaling applications. Developers can easily deploy their code from GitHub or other source control systems and have their applications automatically provisioned and scaled to handle traffic spikes.
