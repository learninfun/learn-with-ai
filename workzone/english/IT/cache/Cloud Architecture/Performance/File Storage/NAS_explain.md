NAS stands for Network Attached Storage. It is a device that connects to a network and allows multiple users to access and share files and data from a centralized location. NAS devices can be accessed over a wired or wireless network, and they can offer a range of features including data backup, media streaming, and remote access.

Example: A small business may use a NAS device to store and share files between employees. They can set up access permissions and user accounts to ensure that only authorized persons can access sensitive data. The device can also be set up to automatically backup data to prevent any loss or corruption. Additionally, if an employee needs to access files while away from the office, they can use remote access features to log in and retrieve the necessary files.
