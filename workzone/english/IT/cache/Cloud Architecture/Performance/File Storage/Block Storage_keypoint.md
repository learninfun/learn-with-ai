1. Block storage involves the storage of data in fixed-sized blocks of data (usually 512 bytes).
2. Block storage is often used for database storage, where data is frequently read and written.
3. Block storage is available in both on-premises and cloud-based environments.
4. Block storage is typically more expensive than other types of storage, such as object storage.
5. Block storage can provide faster access times than other types of storage, due to its fixed block size.
6. Block storage can be managed using a variety of different technologies, including SCSI, SAS, and Fibre Channel.
7. Block storage can be accessed using a range of different protocols, including iSCSI, Fibre Channel, and ATA over Ethernet.
8. Block storage can be provisioned automatically using software-defined storage solutions.
