SAN (Storage Area Network) is a high-speed network that connects servers and storage devices to provide block-level access to centralized data storage for applications and data access across a network. It is a dedicated network that is separate from the local area network (LAN) and operates as a separate network entity.

An example of a SAN could be a large enterprise that needs to store and retrieve large amounts of data from multiple systems throughout the organization. For example, a financial institution might use a SAN to store financial transactions and customer information from multiple databases, while allowing different servers to access and retrieve data as needed. SANs are generally used in data-intensive industries such as healthcare, finance, and media, where large amounts of data are generated and must be accessed quickly and efficiently.
