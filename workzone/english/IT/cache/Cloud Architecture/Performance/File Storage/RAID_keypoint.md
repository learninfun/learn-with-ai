RAID (redundant array of independent disks) is a technology that allows multiple physical disks to be combined into a single logical unit, providing increased performance, data protection, and storage capacity. The key points of RAID are:

1. Redundancy: RAID provides redundancy by storing multiple copies of data across different disks, so if one disk fails, the data can be retrieved from another disk.

2. Striping: RAID uses striping to improve performance by dividing data into blocks and storing each block across multiple disks. This allows data to be read and written to several disks simultaneously, improving performance.

3. Mirroring: RAID uses mirroring to provide redundancy by storing two identical copies of data on separate disks. If one disk fails, the other disk can be used to retrieve the data.

4. Parity: RAID uses parity to provide redundancy by storing an extra bit of information on each disk that can be used to reconstruct data if a disk fails.

5. Levels: RAID is divided into different levels (0-6) that offer different combinations of redundancy and performance.

6. Hot-swapping: Many RAID systems support hot-swapping, which allows failed disks to be removed and replaced without shutting down the system.

7. RAID-controller: RAID requires a RAID-controller to manage the operation of the disks and ensure that data is distributed correctly.
