1. Direct-attached storage (DAS) is a type of storage architecture that involves connecting storage devices directly to a server or computer.

2. DAS is commonly used for small businesses or individual users due to its low cost and simplicity.

3. The performance and capacity of DAS depend on the capabilities of the individual storage devices and the server or computer to which they are attached.

4. DAS can use various storage technologies such as hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and hybrid drives.

5. DAS can be internal or external, with external DAS often used for storage expansion or backup purposes.

6. DAS provides a high degree of data control since the data is stored locally and is directly accessible to the server or computer.

7. However, DAS also has limitations such as lack of scalability, limited redundancy, and potential for single-point failure.

8. To overcome these limitations, DAS can be combined with other storage architectures such as network-attached storage (NAS) or storage area networks (SANs) to provide a more robust and scalable storage solution.
