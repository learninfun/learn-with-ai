RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is a method of combining multiple hard drives into a single logical unit to improve performance, increase storage capacity, and provide data redundancy. RAID employs various techniques to distribute data across multiple drives in a way that enhances read and write speeds and minimizes the risk of data loss due to hardware failure.

For example, RAID 1 or mirroring is a configuration where two or more hard drives are set up to mirror each other. This means that data written to one drive is automatically copied to the other drive(s). If one drive fails, the system can automatically switch to the other drive to prevent data loss, and the failed drive can be replaced without any disruption to the system. RAID 1 is commonly used for mission-critical applications that require high availability and data protection, such as financial transactions, healthcare records, and government databases.
