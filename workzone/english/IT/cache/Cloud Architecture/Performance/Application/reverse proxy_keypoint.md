1. A reverse proxy acts as an intermediary for client requests to a web server.

2. Reverse proxies manage and control incoming network traffic to a web server, helping to protect against common web-based attacks and improve server performance.

3. A reverse proxy can be deployed on a separate hardware device or as a software application running on the same server as the web server.

4. Reverse proxies can be configured to cache commonly requested content, reducing the load on the web server and improving response times for clients.

5. Reverse proxies can also be configured to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers for load balancing purposes.

6. Reverse proxies can be used to provide access controls, authentication, and other security features for web applications.

7. Reverse proxies can be used to hide the true identity and location of the web server, improving security by preventing direct access to the web server.
