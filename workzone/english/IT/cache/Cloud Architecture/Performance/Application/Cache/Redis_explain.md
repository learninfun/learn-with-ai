Redis is an open-source in-memory data structure store that is used as a database, cache, and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. It is often used for real-time applications such as chat applications, real-time analytics, and high-performance systems.

An example of using Redis could be for a real-time leader board for an online game. The game would store the score of each player in a sorted set data structure in Redis. The sorted set would be sorted by the player's score, so the highest score would be at the top of the list. When a player's score changes, Redis would update the sorted set in real-time. The leaderboard page would then query Redis for the top 10 scores and display them to the users. This would all happen in real-time, without needing to use traditional databases, which can be slower and create more latency.
