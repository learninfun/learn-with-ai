Cache is a mechanism to store frequently accessed data in a temporary memory space so that it can be retrieved quickly when required again. It is a technique used to improve the performance of computer systems by reducing the time it takes to access data from the main memory. 

For example, web browsers use cache to store images, scripts, and other frequently accessed content on the local computer. When a user revisits a web page, the browser checks the cache first to see if it already has the content stored. If the content is present in the cache, it is loaded quickly without having to download it again from the server. This reduces the load on the server and makes the web page load faster for the user. Similarly, CPUs use cache to store frequently accessed instructions and data, which helps in speeding up processing time.
