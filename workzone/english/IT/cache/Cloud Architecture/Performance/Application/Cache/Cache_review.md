1. What is a cache in computing?

Answer: A cache is a type of temporary memory that stores frequently accessed data for quick retrieval.

2. How does a cache improve computer performance?

Answer: By storing frequently accessed data in a cache, the computer can retrieve that data more quickly than if it had to retrieve it from a slower storage device like a hard drive. This can improve overall system performance.

3. What is a cache hit?

Answer: A cache hit occurs when the data that an application requests is already stored in the cache, so it can be quickly retrieved without having to be read from a slower storage device.

4. How does cache coherence help maintain data consistency in a multi-processor system?

Answer: In a multi-processor system, multiple processors may access the same data simultaneously. Cache coherence ensures that all caches within the system have the most up-to-date version of the data, so that changes made by one processor are visible to all other processors.

5. What is the difference between a write-through cache and a write-back cache?

Answer: In a write-through cache, data is simultaneously written to both the cache and the main memory, so that both copies are always in sync. In a write-back cache, data is first written to the cache and only later written back to main memory, which can improve performance but also introduces the risk of data inconsistency if the system crashes before the data is written back.
