Dynamic Page Staticing (DPS) is the process of taking dynamic content generated by a server and caching it as a static resource. This can greatly improve website performance and decrease load times for visitors.

For example, let's say you have an e-commerce website with frequently changing product pages. Each time a visitor requests one of these pages, the server has to generate the content dynamically, which can slow down load times.

With DPS, the server would generate the content once and then cache it as a static resource. The next time a visitor requests the page, the server simply serves up the static version, resulting in faster load times and improved performance. 

Overall, DPS helps to reduce the workload on the server and improve website speed, providing a better user experience for visitors.
