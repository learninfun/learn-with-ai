1. Stateless applications do not store client session information.
2. Stateless applications treat each user request as a completely new transaction.
3. Stateless applications are easier to scale and deploy because they do not require complicated session management.
4. Stateless applications can be load balanced across multiple servers.
5. Stateless applications are less complex and easier to maintain because they do not require persistent user data storage.
6. Stateless applications allow for easier fault tolerance and disaster recovery since there is no reliance on a single server.
7. Stateless applications require less memory and storage since client session state is not stored.
8. Stateless applications are more efficient at handling a high volume of requests because they do not require session state lookup.
