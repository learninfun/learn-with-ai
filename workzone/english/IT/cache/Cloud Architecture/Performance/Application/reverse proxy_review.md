1. Q: What is a reverse proxy?
   A: A reverse proxy is a type of proxy server that handles incoming client requests and forwards them to one or more backend servers.

2. Q: What are the benefits of using a reverse proxy?
   A: Reverse proxies can help improve security, scalability, and performance for web applications by providing a single point of entry for clients, load balancing requests across multiple servers, and caching frequently accessed content.

3. Q: How does a reverse proxy differ from a forward proxy?
   A: A reverse proxy sits in front of servers and handles incoming requests from clients, while a forward proxy sits behind clients and handles outgoing requests on their behalf.

4. Q: What is SSL termination?
   A: SSL termination is the process of decrypting incoming SSL traffic at the reverse proxy and forwarding it unencrypted to the backend servers. This can improve performance and reduce resource usage on the backend servers.

5. Q: How can you configure a reverse proxy to redirect traffic to different backend servers based on the requested URL?
   A: You can use URL rewriting or routing rules to redirect traffic to different backend servers based on the requested URL. This can be useful for load balancing or for directing requests to specialized backend servers based on their content.
