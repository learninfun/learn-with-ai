Event streaming is a process of capturing and storing a continuous stream of events or data that are generated by various sources such as sensors, applications, databases, etc. These events are processed in real time or near-real-time to extract insights and gain a better understanding of the system's behavior.

An example of event streaming is a stock trading platform that receives a continuous stream of stock market data, including prices, volumes, and transactions. The platform captures this data and processes it in real-time to identify trades, monitor stock prices and volumes, and detect anomalies, such as sudden spikes or dips in prices. This information is then used to make data-backed decisions and maximize trading profits.

Another example of event streaming is a smart home security system that captures and processes various events generated by sensors, such as motion detectors, door sensors, and cameras. The system then uses this data to monitor and analyze the security of the home, alerting homeowners to potential security breaches, and even automatically turning lights on or off, based on the data received.
