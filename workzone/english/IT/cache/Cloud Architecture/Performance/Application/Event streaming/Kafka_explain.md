Kafka is an open-source distributed streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It allows users to publish and subscribe to streams of records, which can be processed and analysed in real-time. It was originally developed by LinkedIn and later donated to the Apache Software Foundation.

An example of Kafka's use case could be in a stock-trading application where a user wants to see real-time stock updates. Kafka can be used to stream the stock data in real-time from an external source and then process and analyse it continuously. This process can be done by multiple consumers simultaneously, which can read data from the same stream at different intervals. As a result, it provides real-time updates to the users and ensures that the users are up-to-date with the latest market trends. This can be done in a scalable manner, and the data can be stored for further analysis.
