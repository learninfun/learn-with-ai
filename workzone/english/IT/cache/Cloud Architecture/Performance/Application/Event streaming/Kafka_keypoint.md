1. Kafka is a distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant messaging system for handling real-time data streams.

2. Kafka achieves high throughput and low-latency performance by providing persistent storage, fault-tolerance, and distributed processing capabilities.

3. Kafka uses a publish-subscribe model where producers publish data to topics and consumers subscribe to these topics to receive the data.

4. Kafka provides strong durability guarantees by ensuring that data is written to disk and replicated across multiple brokers in the cluster.

5. Kafka supports multiple language APIs including Java, Scala, Python, and C++, making it accessible to a wide range of developers.

6. Kafka stream processing allows for real-time processing of data streams in a fault-tolerant and scalable manner.

7. Kafka provides a variety of integration options with other systems such as Hadoop, Spark, and Flume, making it a versatile tool for data processing.

8. Kafka is open source and maintained by the Apache Software Foundation, ensuring ongoing development and support.
