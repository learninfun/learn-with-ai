Monitoring and logging are important practices in computer science that help professionals keep track of system performance and detect issues. Monitoring refers to the real-time tracking of system performance, while logging involves recording events and activities that occur during a process.

An example of monitoring would be observing the CPU usage of a server in real-time. If the CPU usage goes above a certain limit, an alert can be sent to an administrator to investigate the cause of the high usage.

An example of logging would be recording the failed login attempts to a database. The administrator can use the logs to determine potential security threats and take action to prevent unauthorized access.
