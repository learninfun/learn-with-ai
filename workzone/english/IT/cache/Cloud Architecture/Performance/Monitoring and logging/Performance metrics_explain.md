Performance metrics refer to the measurements that an organization utilizes to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of their operations, products or services. These measurements provide insight into how well the organization is performing and help to identify areas that need improvement.

Example:

One example of a performance metric could be customer satisfaction. This metric measures how satisfied customers are with the products or services that the organization provides. It may be measured through surveys or customer feedback. A high level of customer satisfaction indicates that the organization is meeting its customers' needs and expectations and is likely to result in repeat business and positive word of mouth.
