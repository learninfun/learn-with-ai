1. What is horizontal scaling, and how does it differ from vertical scaling?
Answer: Horizontal scaling involves adding more servers or nodes to a system to increase its capacity and handle more traffic, whereas vertical scaling involves upgrading the hardware or software of a single server to increase its performance.

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of horizontal scaling?
Answer: The advantages of horizontal scaling include improved scalability, fault tolerance, and resiliency to hardware failures. The disadvantages include increased complexity, higher costs, and potential performance degradation due to network latency.

3. What strategies can be used to implement horizontal scaling?
Answer: Strategies for horizontal scaling include load balancing, partitioning data, using stateless architecture, and implementing microservices.

4. How does horizontal scaling impact database performance and consistency?
Answer: Horizontal scaling can improve database performance by distributing the load across multiple servers, but it can also introduce challenges to maintaining consistency, such as data partitioning and maintaining transaction atomicity.

5. What are some common challenges when implementing horizontal scaling, and how can they be addressed?
Answer: Common challenges include maintaining consistency across distributed systems, managing data partitioning, and handling communication between nodes. These challenges can be addressed through techniques such as distributed transactions, sharding, and implementing message queues.
