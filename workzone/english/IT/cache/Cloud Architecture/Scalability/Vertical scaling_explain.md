Vertical scaling involves increasing the capacity of a single machine by adding more resources such as processor power, memory, or storage. In this approach, the resources of a single machine are increased to improve the system's performance or handle larger workloads. 

An example of vertical scaling is upgrading the RAM of a computer. If a computer has 4GB of RAM, and the user wants to run more applications simultaneously, they can add more RAM to increase the system's capacity. Instead of buying a new computer, the user can upgrade the existing one by adding more memory, which will improve the computer's processing speed and allow it to handle more programs at once. Similarly, vertical scaling can be used to increase the processing power or storage of a single server to accommodate additional workloads.
