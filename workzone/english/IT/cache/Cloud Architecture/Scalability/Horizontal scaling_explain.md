Horizontal scaling, also known as scaling out, is the process of adding more servers to distribute the workload and improve performance of an application. In other words, it means expanding the system horizontally by adding more resources such as servers or nodes while keeping the individual server configurations and functionalities the same. 

An example of horizontal scaling is a web application that receives a sudden increase in traffic, which can slow down its performance. To handle this increased traffic, the application can add more servers to distribute the traffic among them equally. This approach allows the application to handle a larger number of requests and serve more users simultaneously. For instance, increasing the number of server instances in AWS Elastic Beanstalk during Black Friday sales is an example of horizontal scaling.
