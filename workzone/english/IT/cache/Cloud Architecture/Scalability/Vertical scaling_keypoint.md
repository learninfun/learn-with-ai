1. Vertical scaling is the process of adding more resources to a single server or node to increase its performance.

2. It involves adding more CPUs, RAM, or disk space to an existing server to handle increased traffic or workload.

3. Vertical scaling can improve application performance, increase processing speed, and improve response times.

4. It is generally easier to implement than horizontal scaling, as it only requires adding resources to a single server.

5. Vertical scaling can be expensive, as it often requires purchasing new hardware or upgrading existing resources.

6. It can also be limited by the physical capacity of the server, which can restrict the maximum level of scaling that can be achieved.

7. Vertical scaling is often used in database management and other applications that require high availability and low latency.
