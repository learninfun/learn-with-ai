1. What is scalability?
Answer: Scalability refers to the ability of a system or application to handle increased workload or traffic without compromising performance or stability.

2. What are some common scalability challenges that organizations might face?
Answer: Common scalability challenges include database bottlenecks, limited network bandwidth, inadequate hardware resources, and inefficient software architecture.

3. How can load balancing help improve scalability?
Answer: Load balancing distributes traffic across multiple servers to ensure that no single server becomes overwhelmed. This can help improve scalability by allowing the application to handle more user requests without slowing down or crashing.

4. What is vertical scaling?
Answer: Vertical scaling involves adding more resources to a single server, such as increasing the CPU or RAM, to improve performance and handle increased traffic. This approach can be limited by the physical capabilities of the server hardware.

5. What is horizontal scaling?
Answer: Horizontal scaling involves adding more servers to a system or application to handle increased traffic or workload. This approach can be more flexible and scalable than vertical scaling, but typically requires additional software and infrastructure to manage the distributed system.
