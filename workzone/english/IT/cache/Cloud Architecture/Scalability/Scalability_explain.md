Scalability refers to the ability of a system, network, or process to handle and accommodate growing amounts of work, load, or demand in a given time-frame without any significant reduction in performance or functionality. In other words, it is the ability of a system to expand or contract its resources to meet changing demand.

For example, a website that can handle increasing traffic and transactions without any downtime or slow response time is considered scalable. Additionally, a software application that can handle a growing number of users or data volumes without any performance degradation or crashing is also an example of scalability. Scalability is crucial for businesses to ensure consistent and uninterrupted operations and avoid lost revenue due to downtime or system failures.
