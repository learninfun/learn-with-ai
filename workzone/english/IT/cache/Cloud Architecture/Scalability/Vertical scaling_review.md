1. What is vertical scaling?
Answer: Vertical scaling is the process of increasing the capacity of a single machine or server by adding more resources, such as RAM, CPU, or storage.

2. What are the advantages of vertical scaling?
Answer: The major advantages of vertical scaling include improved performance, increased availability, and less complexity in managing multiple servers.

3. What are the drawbacks of vertical scaling?
Answer: The main drawback of vertical scaling is that it can be costly, as it requires purchasing new hardware or upgrading existing ones. Additionally, vertical scaling has limits, as eventually, the server may reach its maximum capacity and cannot be scaled up any further.

4. How does vertical scaling compare to horizontal scaling?
Answer: Vertical scaling is a top-down approach in which an existing machine or server is upgraded, whereas horizontal scaling is a bottom-up approach in which additional machines or servers are added to handle increased demand. Horizontal scaling is generally seen as more scalable and cost-effective, but also more complex to manage.

5. What are some common use cases for vertical scaling?
Answer: Vertical scaling is often used in database servers, where increasing the size of the server's memory and storage can improve the performance of the system. It is also commonly used in web servers, where additional CPU and RAM can help manage high traffic loads.
