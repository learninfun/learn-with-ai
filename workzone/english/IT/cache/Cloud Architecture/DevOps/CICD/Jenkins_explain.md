Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps automate various stages of the software development process such as building, testing, and deploying software. Developers use Jenkins to build, test, and deploy their applications automatically. Jenkins is written in Java and has more than 1,000 plugins to support continuous integration and continuous delivery. 

For example, a software development team uses Jenkins to automate their development process. They configure Jenkins to automatically build the code every time a new commit is pushed to the code repository. This process ensures that any bugs introduced into the code are caught early on in the development cycle, making it easier to fix and reducing the overall cost and time requirement of the project. Additionally, the team sets up automated tests that run every time the code is built, ensuring that the new changes to the code do not break existing functionality. Once the code is built and tested, Jenkins can be set up to deploy the application to a deployment server. This process can be triggered automatically when a new build is successful, saving time and streamlining the development process.
