CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment. It is a software development approach that emphasizes the importance of regularly integrating code changes and continuously deploying them to production. It consists of two primary components, Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD).

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers integrate code changes into a shared repository multiple times a day. The purpose of CI is to identify issues or conflicts as early as possible in the development process, preventing them from becoming larger, costlier, and more time-consuming issues. Developers employ automated testing, code review, and continuous feedback to ensure the codebase remains stable and bug-free.

Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) is the practice of automating the release process, which enables teams to deploy high-quality code to production quickly and efficiently. CD ensures that the code and related assets are tested, packaged, released, and deployed to various environments. The practice of CD allows teams to push code into production with a minimal risk of regression.

Example: Suppose an e-commerce website has a new feature added, such as a new payment method. The development team follows the CI/CD practice, and they commit the code changes in the repository, run automated tests and build, and then deploy it to a staging environment to perform user acceptance testing. Once all test cases have passed, the code is deployed to the production environment through various automated delivery pipelines, allowing for continuous deployment. The development team also continuously monitors the website for any issues and actively works on suggesting improvements.
