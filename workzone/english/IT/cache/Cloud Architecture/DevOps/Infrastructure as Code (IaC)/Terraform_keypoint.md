1. Infrastructure as Code: Terraform is a tool used to create and manage infrastructure as code by defining and managing resources through a configuration file.

2. Multi-Cloud Support: Terraform is designed to work with multiple cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and many others.

3. Declarative Programming: With Terraform, users define desired infrastructure state in a configuration file, and Terraform computes the changes needed to achieve that state.

4. Resource Management: Resources are the building blocks of infrastructure in Terraform, and they can be managed at any level of complexity, from a single server to entire cloud infrastructures.

5. Dependency Management: Terraform solves the problem of managing dependencies by automatically creating resources in the right order and allowing for cross-resource dependencies.

6. Idempotent Operations: Terraform provides idempotent operations, which means that a command can be run multiple times without changing the state of a resource if it has already been accomplished.

7. Plan Generation: Terraform generates a detailed plan of what resources will be created or modified before any actual changes are made, allowing users to preview changes before they are applied.

8. Collaboration: Terraform allows users to work together on infrastructure deployment and management using shared code repositories and version control systems.

9. Continuous Integration and Delivery: Terraform can be used in continuous integration and delivery pipelines, allowing for automated and consistent infrastructure deployment and management.

10. Scalability: Terraform can manage infrastructure at any scale, from a single virtual machine to complex cloud-native architectures.
