Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice in which infrastructure is managed and provisioned using code, just like any other software. The idea is to use a programming language to represent the infrastructure as a set of code that can be versioned, tested, and easily deployed. This helps to streamline the process of building and managing infrastructure, making it more efficient, reliable, and scalable.

An example of IaC is the use of tools such as Terraform, Ansible, or CloudFormation to define the resources needed for deploying and managing an application in cloud infrastructure, such as AWS or Azure. This involves writing code that describes the desired state of the infrastructure, and using that code to create the necessary resources, such as servers, load balancers, databases, and security policies.

For example, let's say we want to create a web application that requires a web server, a load balancer, and a database. Using IaC, we would write a Terraform configuration file that describes these resources and their relationships. We can then run Terraform to automatically provision and configure the infrastructure, ensuring that it is consistent and reproducible across multiple environments.

This approach makes it easier to manage infrastructure changes, automate deployments, and maintain consistency across different environments. It also enables version control for infrastructure, just like code, which helps to ensure the stability and security of the system.
