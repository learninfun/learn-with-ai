1. Automate infrastructure provisioning: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows organizations to use automation tools to deploy and configure IT systems and infrastructure. 

2. Reduce human error: IaC minimizes manual intervention and the potential for human error, which can lead to costly downtime or security breaches. 

3. Version control: IaC helps organizations to manage changes to their infrastructure through version control, which allows them to roll back changes easily and maintain consistency across environments. 

4. Agility and scalability: IaC provides organizations with the flexibility to rapidly scale up or down their infrastructure in response to changing business needs. 

5. Consistency: IaC allows for consistent and repeatable infrastructure deployments, which leads to efficiencies and reduces risk. 

6. Faster time-to-market: IaC enables organizations to deliver new products, features, and updates faster through automated infrastructure deployment and testing. 

7. Collaboration: IaC fosters collaboration within teams and between departments by providing a single, shared source of truth for infrastructure configurations. 

8. Compliance and security: IaC tools can enforce compliance and security policies automatically, reducing the risk of non-compliance or data breaches. 

9. Cost savings: IaC can reduce costs by automating routine tasks, improving efficiency, and enabling organizations to use cloud resources more effectively. 

10. Future-proofing: IaC helps organizations to future-proof their infrastructure by keeping up with new technologies and trends in IT.
