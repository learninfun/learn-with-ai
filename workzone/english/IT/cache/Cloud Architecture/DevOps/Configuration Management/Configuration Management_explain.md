Configuration Management refers to the process of managing and organizing components, systems, software applications, and related resources in a systematic and controlled manner. It involves the identification, tracking, and documentation of changes made to any configuration item (CI) throughout the software development lifecycle.

An example of configuration management could be the process of managing a software application. The process involves creating a baseline for the software, identifying and documenting all the components and dependencies, managing the changes made to these components, and ensuring that all the versions of the software are well-documented and controlled. This involves managing the code, libraries, dependencies, and configurations used in the development process.

A typical example of a configuration management tool used in software development is Git, which is used for source control management. In this case, developers use Git to track the source code changes made to their application, and they can easily revert any changes they made to an earlier version, giving them a systematic way of maintaining their application code. Other configuration management tools include Ansible, Puppet, and Chef, which are used in automating software deployments, and ensure that updates and changes are properly managed and implemented without causing any disruptions to the existing production environment.
