1. What is the purpose of Ansible Vault and how is it used?
Answer: Ansible Vault is a tool used for encrypting sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, and SSH keys. It is used by adding a vault password and encrypting the data file, and then decrypting it when needed with the vault password.

2. How can Ansible be used to manage and deploy applications?
Answer: Ansible can be used to automate the deployment process for applications by defining the necessary tasks and configurations in Ansible playbooks. These playbooks can then be executed on multiple servers or environments, ensuring that the same configuration is applied across all instances.

3. What is the difference between Ansible inventory and dynamic inventory?
Answer: Ansible inventory is a static file (usually a text file) that lists the hostnames or IP addresses of the servers to be managed. On the other hand, dynamic inventory is a plugin that fetches the inventory information from an external source such as Amazon EC2 or OpenStack.

4. How can Ansible be used to manage infrastructure as code?
Answer: Ansible can be used to define all infrastructure components as code, thereby enabling version control, testing, and automation. This approach, commonly known as infrastructure as code, helps in achieving infrastructure reliability, scalability, and security.

5. How does Ansible differ from other configuration management tools such as Puppet and Chef?
Answer: Ansible differs from other configuration management tools in that it is agentless, which means it does not require any software to be installed on the servers being managed. It also uses a YAML-based language for defining tasks and configurations, making it simpler to understand and use. Additionally, Ansible has a modular architecture that can be extended easily using custom modules.
