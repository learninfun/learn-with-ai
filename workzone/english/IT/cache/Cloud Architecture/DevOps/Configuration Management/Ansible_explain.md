Ansible is an open-source tool used for IT automation, configuration management and application deployment. It uses a simple syntax and does not require any agents or software installed on the managed nodes, making it easy to manage large numbers of servers and network devices. Ansible works by executing commands over SSH or utilizing native APIs of different systems.

For example, let's say you want to automate the installation and configuration of a web server on multiple servers running Ubuntu. You can use Ansible to create a playbook (a set of instructions) that includes the steps to install and configure the web server on each server. The playbook can also include additional steps to update the security features or set up firewalls. Then you can run the playbook on all the servers at once, and Ansible will execute the instructions without requiring any manual intervention. This not only saves time and effort but also ensures consistency and reduces the chance of human error.
