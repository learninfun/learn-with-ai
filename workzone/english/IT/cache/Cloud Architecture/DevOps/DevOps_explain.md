DevOps is a software development culture and approach that involves the merging of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) in order to improve collaboration and communication between the two teams. DevOps aims to eliminate the barriers that exist between development, testing and deployment stages of the software development lifecycle, by automating processes and workflows, and thereby enabling faster and more reliable product delivery.

Example of DevOps includes the development of a website or an application in a team environment where developers can write code, test it and immediately deploy it to the production environment (Ops). The operations team can identify any issues and feedback the results to the development team immediately so that they can resolve the issue quickly. This continuous feedback cycle helps improve the overall quality of the product and increase its efficiency in production. DevOps principles can also include the use of tools such as Git, Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes to automate and streamline the software development process.
