Monitoring and logging are two related processes that are used to manage and track the performance of a computer system or application. Monitoring refers to the ongoing process of observing the behavior of a system and collecting data on its performance, while logging involves the recording of information about events that occur within a system for later analysis.

For example, an e-commerce website may use monitoring to track customer behavior and identify patterns in purchasing habits. This could involve tracking the number of visitors to the site, their location, and the pages they visit most often. Logging, on the other hand, may be used to record transactions that occur on the website, such as the purchase of a product or the creation of a user account. This information can then be analyzed to identify areas for improvement or to troubleshoot issues that arise with the site or application. Overall, monitoring and logging are essential tools for ensuring the performance, reliability, and security of computer systems and applications.
