1. What is warm standby?

Answer: Warm standby is a type of data backup system where a secondary server is kept ready and operational but not actively serving requests, such that it can quickly take over the responsibilities of the primary server in case of a failure.

2. How does warm standby differ from cold standby?

Answer: In cold standby, the secondary server is completely shut down and only activated in the event of a failure, whereas in warm standby, the secondary server is kept as a warm and ready backup with minimal processing power and storage resources.

3. What are the advantages of using warm standby?

Answer: Warm standby provides quick and reliable failover for critical systems, minimizing downtime and loss of data. It also allows for easy testing and maintenance of the backup system without impacting the primary system.

4. How is data replication performed in a warm standby system?

Answer: Data replication is typically achieved using a combination of log shipping and transactional replication techniques, where changes made to the primary server are continuously sent to the backup server to keep it up-to-date.

5. What are the challenges of implementing a warm standby system?

Answer: Some of the challenges include ensuring consistent replication of data between the primary and backup servers, managing the hardware and network resources required by the backup server, and testing and verifying the failover process to ensure its effectiveness in a real-world scenario.
