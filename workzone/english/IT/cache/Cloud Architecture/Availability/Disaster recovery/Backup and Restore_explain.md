Backup refers to the process of creating a duplicate copy of important data or files to protect them in case the original data is lost, damaged, or corrupted. It is a preventive measure that ensures that data can be recovered in the event of any data loss incident. The backup process involves copying data from a source location to a backup location, typically an external hard drive or cloud-based storage. 

Restore, on the other hand, is the process of recovering data from a backup after data loss or corruption has occurred. It is essentially the reverse of the backup process, where data is copied from the backup location to the original source location. The restore process is crucial as it enables businesses and individuals to recover data and resume normal operations after a data loss event.

For example, A small business can use a backup and restore system to protect its accounting data. In this case, the business could use software to back up its accounting data to an external hard drive or cloud-based storage regularly. If a virus corrupted the accounting data, the business would use the restore feature to bring the most recent, uncorrupted accounting data back into the accounting software.
