Warm Standby is a type of disaster recovery strategy where a backup system or server is kept running and readily available should the primary system fail. The backup system is usually pre-configured with the necessary applications and data but may not be fully operational until it takes over as the primary system.

An example of Warm Standby is a company that has a primary server hosting their website and an identical server on standby in case the primary server fails. The standby server is turned on and all necessary software and data are set up in advance, but the server is not actively running the company's website until it becomes the primary server after the original server fails. This ensures that the company's website remains operational during a server outage, minimizing any downtime that could affect their business operations.
