SLA stands for Service Level Agreement. It is a document that outlines the terms and conditions of the service agreement between a service provider and a customer. It typically includes details such as the expected level of service, the support hours, and the penalties if the service level is not met.

For example, a company may have an SLA with its web hosting provider that specifies a 99.99% uptime guarantee for its website. If the website goes down for more than a specified time, the web hosting provider would be responsible for paying a penalty to the company. By having an SLA in place, both the company and the web hosting provider have a clear understanding of what is expected and can work together to ensure that the website remains up and running as much as possible.
