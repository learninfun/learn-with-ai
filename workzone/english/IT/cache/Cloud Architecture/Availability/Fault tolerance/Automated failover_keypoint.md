- Automated failover is a process in which a backup system automatically takes over the responsibilities of a primary system in the event of a failure.
- This approach helps ensure that critical services stay online even when the primary system experiences issues or goes offline entirely.
- Automated failover typically relies on a variety of monitoring and detection tools to recognize when the primary system has failed and trigger the failover process.
- The backup system is often a duplicate of the primary system, consisting of the same hardware, software, and data to minimize any disruptions caused by the failover.
- A well-designed automated failover system can help minimize downtime, reduce the risk of data loss or corruption, and improve overall system reliability and availability.
- To ensure effective automated failover, organizations need to regularly document and test their failover processes, and they also need to have a comprehensive disaster recovery plan in place that details how the organization will respond to various types of system failures.
