1. Fault tolerance is the ability of a system or a component to continue functioning correctly even in the event of a failure or error in one or more of its components.

2. Fault tolerance ensures that a system remains operational and available to users, even if there is a system failure or an error in a component.

3. Fault tolerance often involves redundancy, duplication or backup of critical components or systems, to ensure that a system can continue to function even if one or more components fail.

4. Failover is the process of switching to a backup or redundant system when a primary system fails or becomes unavailable. Failover ensures that critical systems or services remain available and operational even in the event of a failure.

5. Checkpointing is a method used in fault tolerance that allows a system to save its state on a periodic basis, so that if a failure occurs, the system can restart from the last saved state and avoid the need for a complete system reboot.

6. Fault tolerance requires careful design and planning, including the identification of critical components and services, the selection of appropriate redundancy methods, and the use of testing and monitoring tools to ensure the system remains operational and available.
