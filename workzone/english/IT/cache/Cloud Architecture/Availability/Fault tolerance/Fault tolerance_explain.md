Fault tolerance is the ability of a system to continue operating properly and providing services in the event of partial or complete failure of one or more components. It is achieved through redundancy, which means that multiple identical or equivalent components are used in the system, so that if one fails, the others can take over the workload without causing a system-wide failure.

For example, in a computer network, fault tolerance can be achieved by using multiple servers to host the same website or application. If one server fails, the others will continue to handle the traffic and provide the services without downtime or interruption. This ensures continuity of service and prevents loss of data or revenue. Another example is in a RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) system where if one hard drive fails, the data can still be accessed and recovered from the other drives in the array.
