1. Scalability: Cloud architecture provides scalability, allowing businesses to easily expand or reduce resources as needed.

2. On-Demand Self-Service: The cloud architecture allows users to easily allocate computing resources using web-based interfaces or APIs.

3. Resource Pooling: Cloud architecture utilizes resource pooling, which allows multiple users to share computing resources such as servers and storage, providing economies of scale and efficient use of resources.

4. Rapid Elasticity: Cloud architecture provides rapid elasticity, enabling businesses to easily scale computing resources up and down as needed and only pay for what they use.

5. Measured Service: Cloud architecture provides measured service, allowing businesses to monitor and optimize their resources to meet specific performance and cost targets.

6. Security: Cloud providers offer advanced security measures, including data backup and disaster recovery, to ensure data safety and access control.

7. Multi-tenancy: Cloud architecture employs multi-tenancy, allowing users to share resources with other users while maintaining data segregation and access control.

8. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS): Cloud architecture supports Infrastructure-as-a-Service, allowing users to access virtualized computing resources, networks, and storage.

9. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS): Cloud architecture supports Platform-as-a-Service, enabling businesses to deploy applications on a cloud platform without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.

10. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS): Cloud architecture supports Software-as-a-Service, which allows users to access software applications on a subscription basis without having to manage the underlying hardware or software.
