1. What is network security and how can it be achieved?
	A: Network security refers to the protection of a network and its resources from unauthorized access, theft, or damage. It can be achieved through the use of firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, access controls, and regular network monitoring.

2. What is a brute-force attack and how can it be prevented?
	A: A brute-force attack is a type of cyber attack where the attacker attempts to guess a password or encryption key by systematically trying every possible combination until they find the correct one. It can be prevented by using strong, complex passwords, limiting login attempts, and using multi-factor authentication.

3. What is phishing and how can it be identified and prevented?
	A: Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where the attacker sends an email or message, usually posing as a legitimate individual or organization, in an attempt to trick the recipient into providing sensitive information such as passwords or credit card numbers. It can be identified and prevented by looking for warning signs such as suspicious URLs or email addresses, grammar or spelling errors, and requests for sensitive information.

4. What is data encryption and how can it be used to enhance security?
	A: Data encryption is the process of converting plain text into cipher text using mathematical algorithms, in order to protect sensitive information from being read or accessed by unauthorized parties. It can be used to enhance security by ensuring that even if data is intercepted, it is unreadable without the correct decryption key.

5. What is a firewall and how does it protect against cyber attacks?
	A: A firewall is a network security system that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules. It can protect against cyber attacks by blocking unauthorized access to a network, limiting the spread of malware, and preventing hackers from taking control of a system or stealing data.
