1. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious code into web pages viewed by other users.
2. It occurs when untrusted data is sent by a web application to a user's browser without proper validation and sanitation.
3. Attackers can use phishing emails or fake login pages to trick users into running malicious scripts on their devices.
4. XSS attacks can be classified as reflected, stored or DOM-based based on how the malicious script is delivered and executed.
5. The impact of XSS attacks can range from session hijacking to theft of sensitive data such as usernames and passwords.
6. Prevention measures include input validation and sanitization, Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation, and regular security testing and reviews.
