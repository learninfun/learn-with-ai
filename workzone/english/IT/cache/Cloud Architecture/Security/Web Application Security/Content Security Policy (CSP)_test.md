1. What is Content Security Policy (CSP)?
Answer: Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security framework that allows web developers to specify which content sources are trusted on their site and which are not. It helps prevent cross-site scripting attacks and other malicious code injections from unauthorized sources.

2. How does CSP enhance security on a website?
Answer: CSP enhances security on a website by allowing only trusted sources for content, such as scripts, images, videos, and other types of media. It prevents malicious scripts from being executed on the site, protecting against XSS attacks, code injection, and other types of malware.

3. What are the main components of a CSP policy?
Answer: The main components of a CSP policy include the source list, which defines the trusted sources for various types of content; the directive list, which specifies the rules for how each content type should be treated; and the reporting mechanism, which provides feedback on policy violations.

4. How is a CSP policy enforced?
Answer: A CSP policy is enforced by the browser, which checks the content against the specified directives and source lists. If any violations are detected, the browser will block the content from being loaded or executed.

5. Can CSP prevent all types of web attacks?
Answer: No, CSP cannot prevent all types of web attacks, but it can significantly reduce the risk of some common types of attacks, such as XSS and code injection. Other security measures, such as SSL/TLS encryption, strong authentication, and regular software updates, are also necessary to ensure comprehensive web security.
