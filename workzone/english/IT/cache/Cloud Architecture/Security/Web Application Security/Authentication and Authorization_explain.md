Authentication and authorization are two key concepts in computer security used to protect sensitive data and restrict access based on a user's identity. Authentication is the process of verifying someone's identity, while authorization is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources based on the user's identity.

For example, when you enter your username and password to log into your bank account or email, you are undergoing authentication. The system checks if the credentials provided match the ones on record to verify your identity. Once authenticated, you are then authorized access to specific functionality, such as transferring funds, based on your user profile and account permissions.

In another example, imagine a secure company file server where users must authenticate themselves using a username and password. Once authenticated, the system checks the user's authorization level to determine whether they have permission to access a specific folder or file. If authorized, they will be granted access to the resources they need; otherwise, they will be denied access. This process helps ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive files or data.
