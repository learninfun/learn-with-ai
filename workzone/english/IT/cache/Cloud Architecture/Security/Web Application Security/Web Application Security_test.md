1. What is a SQL injection attack and how can it be prevented?
Answer: A SQL injection attack is a type of cyber attack where a malicious user injects SQL code into a web application's database. This attack can be prevented by using prepared statements, stored procedures, and input validation to ensure that any user input is properly sanitized.

2. What is cross-site scripting (XSS)? How can it be mitigated?
Answer: Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of cyber attack where an attacker injects malicious code into a web application, often in the form of a script. This can be mitigated by input validation and sanitization, as well as ensuring that only trusted sources are allowed to input data into the application.

3. What is a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack? How can it be prevented?
Answer: A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a type of cyber attack where an attacker floods a web application with traffic, causing it to become unavailable. This can be prevented by implementing rate limiting, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems that can detect and block malicious traffic.

4. What is SSL/TLS and why is it important for web application security?
Answer: SSL/TLS is a protocol used to encrypt data transmitted between a web application and a user's browser. This is important for web application security because it can prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping, and data tampering.

5. What is a cookie and how can it be used to improve web application security?
Answer: A cookie is a small file that is stored on a user's computer and contains data relating to their interaction with a web application. This can be used to improve web application security by storing session IDs, user preferences, and other data that can be used to personalize and secure a user's experience.
