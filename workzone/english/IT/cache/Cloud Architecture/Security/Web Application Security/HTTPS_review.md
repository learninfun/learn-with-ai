1. What is HTTPS?
- HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of HTTP that uses encryption to protect website users' information.

2. How does HTTPS work?
- HTTPS uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt data sent between a website user's computer and the web server hosting the website.

3. How can you tell if a website is using HTTPS?
- Websites using HTTPS have URLs that begin with "https://" instead of "http://", and display a padlock icon in the browser's address bar.

4. What are the benefits of using HTTPS?
- HTTPS ensures that users' sensitive information, such as login credentials and credit card numbers, is protected from hackers and other unauthorized parties. It also helps prevent phishing attacks and enhances website trust and credibility.

5. What are the potential drawbacks of using HTTPS?
- HTTPS can slow down website loading times due to the encryption process, and it may require additional resources and technical expertise to implement and maintain. Additionally, some older web browsers or devices may not support HTTPS.
