Zero Trust is a cybersecurity model based on the premise that organizations should not automatically trust any user or device trying to access their network, systems or applications, regardless of whether the connection is coming from inside or outside of the organization. The Zero Trust model requires continuous verification of every user or device attempting to access the resources, using context-aware authentication and access control policies.

An example of the Zero Trust model in action could be a financial company that requires employees, contractors, and third-party vendors to authenticate and re-authenticate themselves multiple times before accessing sensitive financial data or networks. Also, the company may use some security measures like network segmentation, micro-segmentation, and application-aware security protocols to prevent unauthorized access or data leakage. Using this model will allow the company to minimize the risk of a data breach by scrutinizing every access attempt, minimizing the attack surface, and keeping a closer watch of network activity to detect and respond to cyber threats in real-time.
