Data protection refers to the practice of securing sensitive or confidential information from unauthorized access or unwarranted use. This can include personal and financial data, medical records, trade secrets, and other types of information that could be misused or exploited by others.

An example of data protection would be encrypting data files with a password or other security measure to prevent unauthorized access. Another example is implementing access controls, such as requiring user authentication and permissions, to ensure that only authorized individuals can access sensitive information. Additionally, organizations can use data backup and disaster recovery plans to protect data from accidental or deliberate loss or destruction. These measures all help to safeguard confidential data and help protect against identity theft, fraud, and other cybercrimes.
