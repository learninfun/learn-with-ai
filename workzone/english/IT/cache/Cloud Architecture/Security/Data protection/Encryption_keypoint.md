1. Encryption is the process of converting data into a coded or scrambled form that can only be read with a specific decryption key.
2. Encryption protects sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals, ensuring data confidentiality.
3. The encryption process involves mathematical algorithms that transform the plaintext into ciphertext.
4. There are two main types of encryption: symmetric encryption, which uses a single key for both encryption and decryption, and asymmetric encryption, which uses two keys, one for encryption and one for decryption.
5. Encryption is widely used in online transactions, communication, and data storage to protect data from cyber attacks, data breaches, and unauthorized access.
6. Encrypted data is useless to attackers without the decryption key, making encryption a critical security measure for protecting sensitive information.
7. The strength of encryption depends on the length and randomness of the encryption key, as well as the strength of the encryption algorithm.
8. Advances in technology have led to the development of quantum encryption, which uses the principles of quantum mechanics to guarantee communication security.
