1. Key creation - Keys are created using a combination of random number generators and computer algorithms.

2. Key storage - Keys must be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access. This can be done using specialized hardware or software, such as a hardware security module or a key management system.

3. Key distribution - Keys must be distributed securely to authorized users or devices. This can be done using secure communication channels and encryption.

4. Key rotation - Keys should be rotated periodically to maintain their security. This involves creating new keys and securely distributing them while retiring old keys.

5. Key revocation - Keys may need to be revoked if they are compromised or no longer needed. This involves removing the key from all authorized devices and systems.

6. Cryptographic operations - Keys are used to protect data and communications through cryptographic operations, such as encryption, decryption, and digital signatures.

7. Compliance - Key management must comply with applicable standards and regulations, such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR.

8. Audit and logging - Key management systems should maintain detailed logs of all key-related activities, including key creation, distribution, rotation, and revocation. These logs may be used for audit and compliance purposes.
