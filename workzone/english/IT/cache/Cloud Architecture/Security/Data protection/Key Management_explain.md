Key management refers to the process of generating, storing, distributing, maintaining, and revoking cryptographic keys. Cryptographic keys are used to encrypt and decrypt data, secure communications, and verify identities. Key management must ensure that keys are kept safe and that authorized parties are able to use them when needed.

For example, a bank might use key management to secure its online banking system. The bank would generate unique cryptographic keys for each customer and store them securely on its servers. When a customer accesses the online banking system, the system would use the customer's key to encrypt and decrypt data, ensuring that only the customer can access their account information. The key management system would also regularly check to ensure that the customer's key has not been compromised, and if necessary, revoke and replace the key. This process helps to protect the bank and its customers from unauthorized access and fraudulent activity.
