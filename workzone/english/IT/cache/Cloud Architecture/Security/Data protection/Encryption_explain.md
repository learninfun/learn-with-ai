Encryption is the process of converting plain text or data into a code or cipher so that it cannot be read by anyone who does not have the key to decode it. It is a security measure used to protect sensitive information from being intercepted, stolen or tampered with.

For example, if you want to send a sensitive email message to someone, you can encrypt it by using a software program to scramble the data into a code that can only be deciphered by someone who has the decryption key. The message can be sent through the internet or any other communication channel without being intercepted by hackers or third parties. The recipient of the message can then decode the message by using the key, and read the original message. This ensures the security and privacy of the message.
