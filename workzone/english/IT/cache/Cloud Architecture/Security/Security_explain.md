Security refers to the measures that are taken to protect against potential threats, risks or dangers. This could involve anything from securing physical assets, such as a property or computer network, to managing access control, preventing cyberattacks or implementing emergency response plans.

For instance, a bank may implement various security measures to protect its assets and customers’ data. These measures include installing security cameras, hiring armed guards, securing the bank’s database with encryption technology, and implementing strict login credentials to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, strict policies may be put in place for staff handling cash and customer information, such as having employees perform periodic background checks and having them sign confidentiality agreements. All these measures collectively ensure the bank remains secure and safe from potential threats.
