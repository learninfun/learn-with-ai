1. What is the difference between a vulnerability scan and a penetration test in security testing?

Answer: A vulnerability scan is an automated process that identifies potential security vulnerabilities. A penetration test simulates a real-world hack attempt to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.

2. What is SQL injection and how can it be prevented during security testing?

Answer: SQL injection is a type of malicious attack where an attacker injects malicious SQL code into a database query. It can be prevented by using prepared statements, input validation, and limiting user privileges.

3. Why is it important to perform regular security testing on web applications?

Answer: Web applications that are not properly secured can be vulnerable to attacks and can compromise sensitive user data. Regular security testing can help identify vulnerabilities and prevent data breaches.

4. What is cross-site scripting (XSS) and how can it be prevented during security testing?

Answer: Cross-site scripting is a type of attack where an attacker injects malicious code into a website that is accessed by unsuspecting users. It can be prevented through proper input validation, sanitization of user inputs, and use of security protocols such as HTTPS.

5. What is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack and how can it be prevented during security testing?

Answer: A DoS attack is a type of attack where an attacker floods a website or network with traffic, causing it to become unavailable to users. It can be prevented by using load testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, implementing throttling or rate limiting to prevent excessive traffic, and using distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection.
