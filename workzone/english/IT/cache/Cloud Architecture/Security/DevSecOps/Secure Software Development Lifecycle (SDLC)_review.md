1. What are the six phases of the Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)?
- Planning, Requirements Gathering, Design, Implementation, Testing, Maintenance
2. What is the purpose of conducting a threat modeling analysis during the SDLC?
- To identify potential security vulnerabilities and threats to the system and prioritize them for remediation
3. Why is it important to involve security experts early in the SDLC process?
- To identify potential security risks and design secure coding practices from the beginning, ultimately decreasing the risk of vulnerabilities in the software 
4. What are some common security testing techniques used during the SDLC?
- Penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and code reviews 
5. How can an organization ensure that security is integrated throughout the entire SDLC process?
- By using secure design principles, holding security awareness training, performing ongoing risk assessments, monitoring software code for vulnerabilities, and ensuring that security is considered in all phases of the development lifecycle.
