1. Understanding the System Architecture: Threat modeling begins with a complete understanding of the system architecture, including all components, data flows, and interactions.

2. Identifying Assets and Threats: Once the system architecture is understood, assets need to be identified, which includes any data, applications, hardware, or other components that require protection. Threats need to be identified as well, which can include anything that could potentially cause harm to the system.

3. Analyzing Vulnerabilities: Once assets and threats are identified, the system architecture needs to be analyzed for vulnerabilities. This may include forensic analysis, penetration testing, or other security testing methods.

4. Prioritizing Threats: Once vulnerabilities are identified, they need to be prioritized based on their potential impact and likelihood of exploitation.

5. Developing Countermeasures: Once threats are prioritized, countermeasures need to be developed to address them. This can include anything from improved authentication, encryption, or other security measures.

6. Embedding Security into Development: Finally, security needs to be embedded into the development process from the beginning. All product design, code development, and testing should include security as a fundamental aspect of the project.
