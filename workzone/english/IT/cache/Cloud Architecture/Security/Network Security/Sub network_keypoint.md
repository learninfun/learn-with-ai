1. A subnet is a smaller network contained within a larger network.

2. Its purpose is to divide the larger network into smaller, more manageable pieces.

3. Each subnet has its own unique address range and can be controlled independently.

4. Subnetting allows for more efficient use of IP addresses and reduces network congestion.

5. It enhances security by isolating portions of a network and controlling access to them.

6. Subnets can be created using various methods, including fixed subnetting, variable length subnetting, and classless inter-domain routing.

7. To implement subnets, network administrators must configure routers and switches to recognize and route traffic to the correct subnet.

8. Subnet masks are used to identify which portion of an IP address represents the network and which represents the host.

9. Subnetting can be applied to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

10. Proper planning and design of subnets is essential for optimal network performance and scalability.
