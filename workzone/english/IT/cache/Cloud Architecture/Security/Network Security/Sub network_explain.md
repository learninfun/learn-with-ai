A subnetwork, also known as a subnet, is a smaller network that is created by dividing a larger network into smaller segments. The idea behind subnetworking is to divide a network into smaller, more manageable pieces, which can help to increase network efficiency and security.

An example of subnetworking is in a home network where multiple devices are connected to a single router. The router creates a local network that allows each device to communicate with each other. However, if an individual wants to divide the network into smaller groups, they can use subnetting. For instance, the individual can create two subnetworks, one for the smart home devices such as security cameras and thermostats, and the other one for personal devices such as laptops and smartphones. This subnetworking ensures that the smart home devices do not have access to personal devices and vice versa, enhancing security.

Another example is in a corporate setting where a single network is divided into subnetworks for different departments. For example, HR staff may have their own subnetwork that is separate from the finance department's subnetwork, again enhancing security and data privacy.
