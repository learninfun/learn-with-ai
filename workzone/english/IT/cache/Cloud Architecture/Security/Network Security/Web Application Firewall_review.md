1. What is a Web Application Firewall (WAF)?
Answer: A WAF is a security solution designed specifically to protect web applications from online threats and attacks by monitoring and filtering incoming traffic.

2. What are some common threats that a Web Application Firewall can protect against?
Answer: Common threats that a WAF can protect against include SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and file inclusion exploits.

3. How does a Web Application Firewall differ from a traditional firewall?
Answer: A traditional firewall is designed to protect the network perimeter, while a WAF is designed to protect specific web applications running on a web server. Additionally, a WAF uses more sophisticated methods of filtering traffic than a traditional firewall, such as analyzing HTTP traffic and inspecting application payloads.

4. How does a Web Application Firewall work?
Answer: A WAF sits between the web server and incoming traffic, analyzing and filtering requests based on a set of predefined rules. These rules can include things like blocking certain IP addresses or blocking requests containing specific keywords or malicious payloads.

5. What are some best practices for configuring a Web Application Firewall?
Answer: Some best practices for configuring a WAF include regularly updating rulesets to cover new threats, configuring the WAF to inspect all traffic to and from the web server, and properly testing the WAF before deploying it in a production environment. Additionally, it's important to monitor WAF logs and alerts for potential false positives or other issues.
