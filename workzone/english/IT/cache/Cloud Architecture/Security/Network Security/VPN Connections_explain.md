VPN stands for Virtual Private Network, which is a secure way to connect to the internet or a private network remotely. VPN connections encrypt your data and create a virtual tunnel through which your data travels, protecting your online activity from prying eyes.

When you connect to a VPN, your device first connects to the VPN server, which then acts as a gateway to the internet or the network you want to access. Your deviceâ€™s IP address is masked by the IP address of the VPN server, providing a layer of anonymity.

Example: Let's say you're traveling and want to access your work network, which is located in a different city or country. Instead of exposing your company's sensitive data to potential threats on public Wi-Fi, you can use a VPN connection to create a secure network connection. This way, you can safely access your company's intranet and work resources from anywhere in the world.
