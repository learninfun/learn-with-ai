- A web application firewall (WAF) is a security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing traffic between a web application and the internet.
- WAFs are designed to protect web applications from attacks such as SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common web exploits.
- WAFs use a variety of techniques to detect and block attacks, including signature-based detection, behavioral analysis, and anomaly detection.
- WAFs can be deployed in a variety of ways, including as a hardware appliance, a virtual appliance, or a cloud-based service.
- When selecting a WAF solution, it's important to consider factors such as performance, ease of integration with existing infrastructure, and the level of customization and control offered by the solution.
