- Firewall is a security mechanism that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security policies.
- A firewall serves as a barrier between an organizationâ€™s internal network and the public Internet or any other untrusted network, such as a partner or vendor network.
- Firewalls can prevent unauthorized access to the network, protect against malware and prevent data loss or theft.
- Firewalls work by examining each packet of data that enters or exits the network and comparing it to a set of predefined rules.
- Firewall policies can be based on the source, destination, and contents of network traffic or on the user identity or device type. 
- Typical types of firewalls include network, host-based, and application firewalls.
- Network firewalls, such as packet-filtering firewalls, are deployed at the network perimeter and can block traffic based on IP address and port number.
- Host-based firewalls run on individual devices and can provide additional security by blocking traffic at the application level.
- Application firewalls are designed to protect against threats that target specific applications or services, such as web applications or email servers. 
- Firewalls can be configured to log and report on network activity and generate alerts if suspicious activity is detected.
