1. What is the maximum number of subnets that can be created from a Class C network with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.192?
Answer: 4 subnets

2. What is the difference between subnet mask and default subnet mask?
Answer: Subnet mask is used to divide a network into smaller subnets, while default subnet mask is the subnet mask used by default based on the network class.

3. How does subnetting improve network performance?
Answer: Subnetting reduces the size of broadcast domains, which reduces network traffic and improves the overall performance of the network.

4. What is the purpose of a subnet mask?
Answer: The subnet mask is used to determine the network address and the host address within a network.

5. How can you determine the valid host range in a subnet?
Answer: The valid host range in a subnet can be determined by subtracting the subnet mask from the network address, and then adding one to the result for the lower bound and subtracting one from the broadcast address for the upper bound.
