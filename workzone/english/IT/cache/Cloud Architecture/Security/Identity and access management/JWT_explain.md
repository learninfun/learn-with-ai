JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It is a security token format that is used to authenticate and authorize users on the web. A JWT token is created by a server upon successful login and is then sent to the client, typically as a cookie or in the HTML5 LocalStorage. The client then sends this token in the header of each subsequent request to the server for authentication and authorization.

An example of a JWT token looks like the following:

eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IlNpbHZhbmEiLCJpYXQiOjE1MTYyMzkwMjJ9.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c

This token consists of three parts separated by dots: the header, the payload, and the signature. The header contains information about the token, such as its algorithm and type. The payload contains data about the user, such as their username, user ID, and any extra claims. The signature is used to verify that the token has not been tampered with and allows the server to trust the data in the token.

To decode the above token, you can use a JWT decoding tool like jwt.io.
