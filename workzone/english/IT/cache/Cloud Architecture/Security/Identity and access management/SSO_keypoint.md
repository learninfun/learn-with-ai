1. Single Sign-On (SSO) is a technology that allows users to log in to multiple applications with a single set of credentials.

2. SSO eliminates the need for users to remember multiple usernames and passwords, making it easier for them to access the necessary applications and complete tasks efficiently.

3. SSO improves security by reducing the number of login credentials users need to manage, reducing the risk of insecure passwords and login problems.

4. SSO systems rely on authentication protocols such as SAML or OAuth to securely exchange user information between applications.

5. Organizations can use SSO to streamline access across multiple internal systems and external cloud-based applications, enhancing productivity and enhancing user experience.

6. SSO is a key component of access management systems, which help organizations control access to sensitive data and resources.

7. SSO can be implemented using on-premises or cloud-based solutions, and can be integrated into existing identity and access management systems.
