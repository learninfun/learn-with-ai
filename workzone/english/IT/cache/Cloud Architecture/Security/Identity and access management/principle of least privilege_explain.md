Principle of least privilege is a security best practice that restricts access rights and permissions to only the essential resources required to perform a task or job function. This practice helps to minimize a system's attack surface and mitigate risk of security breaches or unauthorized access.

For example, a user account with administrative access should only be utilized when performing administrative tasks. If the user only needs to perform basic tasks, such as accessing files, editing documents or emails, then they should only have user-level access rights to those resources. By limiting user access rights to only what they need to complete their job function, the principle of least privilege improves security and reduces the potential for cyberattacks or insider threats.
