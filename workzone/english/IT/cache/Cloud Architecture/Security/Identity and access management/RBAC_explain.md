RBAC stands for Role-Based Access Control. It is a security model that restricts system access to authorized users based on their assigned role or job responsibility. In other words, users are given access to only those resources and functions necessary for their specific role, and they cannot access anything beyond that.

An example of RBAC is in a hospital. The different roles in a hospital could be doctors, nurses, administrative staff, and janitors. Each role would have different access rights and permissions to the hospitalâ€™s databases, rooms, and equipment. For instance, doctors would have access to patient records, prescription information, and medical equipment while nurses would have access to patient information, medications, and relevant medical equipment. Administrative staff would have access to only administrative documents and schedules while janitors would have access to only cleaning supplies and equipment. In this way, the RBAC system ensures that each staff member only has access to the resources that are relevant to their jobs and nothing beyond that, keeping sensitive information and assets secure.
