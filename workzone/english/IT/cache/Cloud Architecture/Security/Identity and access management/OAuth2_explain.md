OAuth2 is an authorization framework that enables third-party applications to access protected resources on behalf of a user without needing access to the user's credentials. It provides secure and standardized access control for APIs, websites, and applications.

Example: Suppose you want to use your Google account to log in to a third-party app such as Spotify, which needs access to your Google Drive files. Instead of sharing your Google username and password with Spotify, you can use OAuth2 to authorize Spotify to access your Google Drive using your Google account. You would be redirected to Google's login page where you'd provide your credentials, then you'd authorize the app to access your data on your behalf. Once authorized, Spotify could access your Google Drive without any further action required from you. This ensures that you don't need to share your sensitive credentials (like passwords) with every new app you use.
