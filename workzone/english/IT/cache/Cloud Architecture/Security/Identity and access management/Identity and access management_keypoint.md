1. Identification: Identifying the user is the first fundamental step in identity and access management.

2. Authentication: Authentication refers to validating a user's identity through a set of credentials, such as passwords, biometric data, and security tokens.

3. Authorization: Authorization refers to the role-based access control system that determines which resources and data a user can access based on their job functions or access levels.

4. Access control: This involves tools and methods to manage access, like enforcing passwords, IP address whitelisting, and multifactor authentication.

5. Auditing and reporting: IAM systems should have mechanisms to track users' actions, generate reports, and monitor security events.

6. User provisioning and deprovisioning: User provisioning and deprovisioning refer to the process of providing employees with access to tools and resources as soon as they are hired, and removing access when they no longer need it.

7. Single sign-on: This refers to allowing users to access multiple applications with one set of credentials, removing the need to log in separately to each system.

8. Compliance: IAM must comply with regulatory standards such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.

9. Governance: Governance refers to the policies, procedures, and processes that govern access control, user authentication, user management, and privileges.



Overall, identity and access management is a critical part of cybersecurity that ensures the appropriate identification, authentication, and authorization of users in an organization.
