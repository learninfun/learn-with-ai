1. What is OAuth2?
Answer: OAuth2 is an authorization framework that allows external applications to access user data through a third-party service such as Facebook, Google, or GitHub.

2. What is the difference between OAuth1 and OAuth2?
Answer: OAuth1 relies on cryptographic signatures, while OAuth2 relies on bearer tokens. OAuth2 also introduces new grant types, such as the Implicit Grant and the Authorization Code Grant.

3. What is the Authorization Code Grant in OAuth2?
Answer: The Authorization Code Grant is a flow in which the user is redirected to the OAuth2 provider to grant authorization to the external application. The provider then generates an authorization code, which the application exchanges for an access token that can be used to access user data.

4. What is the purpose of access tokens in OAuth2?
Answer: Access tokens are used to authenticate requests made by the external application to the OAuth2 provider on behalf of the user. They typically have a limited lifespan and can be revoked at any time.

5. Can OAuth2 be used for authentication as well as authorization?
Answer: Yes, OAuth2 can be used for both authentication and authorization, although it is primarily designed for the latter. Some implementations of OAuth2, such as OpenID Connect, extend the framework to support authentication as well.
