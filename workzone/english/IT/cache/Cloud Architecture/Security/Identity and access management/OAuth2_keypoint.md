1. OAuth2 is an open standard that allows users to grant limited access to their resources on one website, to another website, without sharing their credentials.

2. It allows users to grant access to their resources (like photos, videos, documents, etc.) to third-party apps without sharing their passwords.

3. It improves the user experience by eliminating the need to create yet another account on a website, and reducing the risk of stolen credentials.

4. OAuth 2.0 uses tokens instead of passwords to access the user's resources. This ensures that the user's credentials are not shared between apps and that they remain protected.

5. OAuth2 allows users to control what information they share with the third-party app which makes it more secure.

6. OAuth2 has become the de facto standard for authorization and authentication on the web.

7. OAuth2 uses different types of authentication flows depending on the type of client, whether itâ€™s a web app, mobile app, or desktop client.

8. OAuth2 is designed to be a flexible authorization framework that can be easily adapted to specific use cases.
