Authorization is the process of granting access or permission to a user or entity to perform an action or access a resource.

For example, when a user logs into their online banking account, the system will verify their identity through authentication (e.g. username and password). Once the user is authenticated, the system will then check their authorization level to determine what actions they can perform within their account, such as view their account balance or transfer funds to another account. The authorization level is determined by the user's role, which could be a standard customer, a bank teller, or an administrator. If the user tries to perform an action they are not authorized for, such as modifying another user's account details, they will receive an error message or be denied access.
