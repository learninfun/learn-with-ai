1. What is SSO and how does it work?

Answer: SSO, or Single Sign-On, is a method of authentication that allows users to access multiple applications using just one set of login credentials. SSO works by creating a centralized authentication server that validates user credentials and provides access to all applications that the user is authorized to use.

2. What are the benefits of using SSO?

Answer: The benefits of using SSO include improved security, reduced login friction, simplified administration, and increased user productivity. SSO helps to simplify the login process for users, reduce the risk of password-related security incidents, and streamline access management for IT administrators.

3. What are some of the different SSO protocols?

Answer: Some of the different SSO protocols include SAML, OAuth, OpenID Connect, and Kerberos. These protocols provide different methods for authenticating users, exchanging authorization information, and managing user sessions across multiple applications.

4. How does SSO differ from traditional authentication methods?

Answer: SSO differs from traditional authentication methods in that it allows users to access multiple applications using just one set of login credentials. Traditional authentication methods require users to remember separate usernames and passwords for each application, which can be difficult to manage and increase the risk of password-related security incidents.

5. What are some common use cases for SSO?

Answer: Some common use cases for SSO include enterprise applications, cloud services, social media platforms, and online marketplaces. SSO is particularly useful for organizations that use multiple applications and services, as it helps to streamline access management and improve the user experience.
