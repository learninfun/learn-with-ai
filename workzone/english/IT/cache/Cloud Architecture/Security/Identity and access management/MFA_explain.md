MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) is a security mechanism that requires users to prove their identity through multiple methods of authentication. It adds an extra layer of security to the login process by requiring the user to validate their identity using two or more credentials.

For example, a user may be required to enter their password and then provide a verification code that is sent to their mobile phone. This way, even if someone steals the user's password, they would not be able to access their accounts without the additional verification code.

Other examples include biometric authentication, such as facial recognition or fingerprint scanning, smart cards, security tokens, or security questions.

MFA is essential in today's digital world, where cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated, and traditional passwords are no longer enough to keep sensitive information secure.
