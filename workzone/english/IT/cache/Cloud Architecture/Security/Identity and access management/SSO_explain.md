Single Sign-On (SSO) is a system that allows a user to use a single set of credentials to access multiple applications or systems. It saves users from the trouble of logging in with different usernames and passwords for each application or system they use. Once a user has logged in through SSO, they can access other applications or systems without having to re-enter their credentials.

An example of SSO is Google Sign-in, which allows users to log in to various websites and applications using their Google account. With Google Sign-in, users do not have to remember different usernames and passwords for each website or application they use. They can simply click on the Google Sign-in button on the website or application and enter their Google credentials to sign in. This provides a seamless and secure login experience for users while also reducing the burden of remembering multiple usernames and passwords.
