1. Identification: The user provides their username or other identification information to be authenticated.
2. Authentication: The system verifies that the user is who they claim to be by validating their credentials, such as their password or biometric data.
3. Authorization: Once authentication is completed, the system checks the user's access rights based on their role, group membership, or other criteria.
4. Auditing and Logging: The system records all authentication attempts and access activity for accountability and forensic purposes.
5. Multifactor Authentication: Using more than one authentication factor, such as a password and a fingerprint, can boost security.
6. Password Policies: Enforcing strong password policies, such as complexity requirements and expiration dates, can help reduce the risk of password-related attacks.
7. Security Protocols: Following secure security protocols such as SSL or two-factor authentication can help to prevent data breaches.
