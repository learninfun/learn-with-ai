Identity and access management (IAM) is a framework of policies, processes, and technologies that are designed to manage and secure digital identities and access to systems, applications, and data. It involves creating and managing user accounts, defining access privileges, monitoring user activities, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

A practical example of IAM is a company's employee onboarding process. When a new employee joins the company, the IAM system creates a digital identity for them with unique login credentials to access company resources. Based on their role and responsibilities, access privileges are defined for different systems and applications, and the employee is granted access accordingly. The IAM system then monitors their activities and logs information for audit purposes. When the employee leaves the company, their access privileges are revoked, and their digital identity is deleted from the IAM system to prevent unauthorized access to company resources. This process ensures that the company maintains appropriate levels of security and control over its digital assets.
