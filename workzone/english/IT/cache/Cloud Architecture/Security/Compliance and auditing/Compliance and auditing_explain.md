Compliance refers to the act of following rules, regulations, standards, or laws that are set by governing bodies, organizations, or industries. Compliance ensures that individuals or entities are abiding by the agreed-upon norms and regulations, hence avoiding any legal, financial, or reputational penalties. Compliance can be mandatory or voluntary, depending on the context.

Auditing, on the other hand, is an independent process of examining and evaluating an organization's financial, operational, or other types of information systems to determine whether they are in compliance with regulations or internal policies. Auditing aims to provide reasonable assurance that an organization is accurately representing its financial position and operating within the parameters of its policies.

For example, a healthcare organization must comply with healthcare regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). An auditor would conduct an audit of the organization's processes and procedures to ensure that patient privacy rights are not violated and adequate security measures are in place to safeguard personal information. The auditor would check for compliance with HIPAA regulations and report any non-compliances to the organization's management for corrective action.
