Industry standards are officially recognized requirements, recommendations, and specifications in a specific field of professional activity. Companies, associations, and other organizations establish industry standards to enhance safety, quality, and output by creating requirements for equipment, design outlets, and operational procedures.

An example of industry standards could be the International Organization for Standardization's (ISO) series of Quality Management Systems (QMS) standards, which define a framework for a company to operate within. This standard specifies requirements for quality management systems, such as documentation, procedures, training, and continuous improvement. This standard aims to improve customer satisfaction, reduce waste, and increase efficiency across industries. By adhering to these standards, companies can demonstrate their commitment to quality products and services, competitiveness, and regulatory compliance.
