Legal requirements are the specific regulations or laws that an individual, organization or business must comply with. They are put in place to ensure that everyone follows the same standard or code of conduct in order to maintain order, protect individuals, and promote a healthy or safe environment.

An example of a legal requirement would be minimum wage laws. This law states that an employer must pay their employees a minimum set wage for the hours they work. In the United States, the current federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. Non-compliance with this law can result in penalties, fines, and legal action. Therefore, businesses are required to have proper records to keep track of the hours worked and the wages paid to their employees to ensure they are following legal requirements.
