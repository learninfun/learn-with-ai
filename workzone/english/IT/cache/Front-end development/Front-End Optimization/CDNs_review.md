1. What is a CDN? 
Answer: A CDN stands for Content Delivery Network, which is a network of servers distributed in multiple geographical locations that delivers content to users based on their location for faster and more efficient delivery.

2. How does a CDN work? 
Answer: A CDN caches or stores content on its servers, which are located closer to the user, allowing for faster access to the content. When a user requests content from a website, it is delivered from the closest CDN server instead of the origin server, reducing latency and improving site performance.

3. What are the advantages of using a CDN? 
Answer: Using a CDN can significantly improve website performance by reducing page load times, improving website availability, increasing website security, and reducing server load.

4. How do you set up a CDN for your website? 
Answer: To set up a CDN for your website, you need to choose a CDN provider, create an account, and configure your website to deliver content through the CDN. This can be done by integrating the CDN with your website through plugins or by modifying your website's code.

5. What are some popular CDN providers? 
Answer: There are several popular CDN providers, including Cloudflare, Akamai, Amazon CloudFront, MaxCDN, and Fastly. Each provider offers different features and pricing plans, so it's important to choose a provider that fits your website's needs and budget.
