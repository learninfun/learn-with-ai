Performance optimization in software engineering is the process of improving the efficiency, speed, and scalability of a system or application. It involves identifying software components or processes that are slowing down the system and applying techniques or strategies to alleviate the bottlenecks and improve performance.

An example of performance optimization could be improving the load time of a webpage. This involves analyzing the code and assets of the webpage to identify any unnecessary resources, optimizing image file sizes, and caching frequently accessed data. By reducing the page load time, the user experience will be improved, resulting in increased engagement and better SEO.
