1. Q: What is the main purpose of performance optimization?
A: To enhance the efficiency of a system or process, lowering response time, and increasing productivity.

2. Q: What are some of the most common techniques used in performance optimization?
A: Techniques such as code optimization, server-side configuration optimization, database optimization, caching, and load balancing.

3. Q: What are some of the most important metrics to measure to assess performance optimization?
A: Metrics such as response time, latency, throughput, memory usage, and CPU utilization.

4. Q: What is the difference between proactive and reactive performance optimization?
A: Proactive optimization involves optimizing a system before performance issues arise, while reactive optimization involves fixing an already existing performance issue.

5. Q: How can you measure the effectiveness of a performance optimization strategy?
A: By comparing performance metrics before and after implementing optimization measures, ideally seeing an improvement in the relevant metrics.
