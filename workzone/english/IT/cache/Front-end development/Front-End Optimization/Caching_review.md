1. What is caching?
Answer: Caching is the process of storing frequently accessed data in a temporary storage area, such as memory or disk, to speed up retrieval times.

2. What is the difference between client-side and server-side caching?
Answer: Client-side caching refers to caching data on the client's device, such as in their web browser, whereas server-side caching refers to caching data on the server, typically using specialized software or hardware.

3. What is cache invalidation?
Answer: Cache invalidation refers to the process of removing cached data when it is no longer valid or has expired, typically due to changes in the underlying data or resources.

4. What is cache poisoning?
Answer: Cache poisoning is a form of attack where an attacker inserts malicious data into a cache, causing subsequent requests to retrieve and use the poisoned data.

5. How can you measure the effectiveness of caching?
Answer: The effectiveness of caching can be measured by analyzing metrics such as cache hit rate, which measures the percentage of requests that are served from the cache instead of the original data source, or cache response time, which measures the time it takes to retrieve data from the cache.
