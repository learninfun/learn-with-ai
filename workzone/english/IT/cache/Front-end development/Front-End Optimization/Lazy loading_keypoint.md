1. Lazy loading is a technique that defers the loading of non-critical resources until they are actually needed. 

2. It can improve page loading speed by only loading resources as they are needed, reducing the initial load time. 

3. It can also reduce server load and bandwidth usage. 

4. It is commonly used for images, videos, and other media files, as well as for certain sections of a website that aren't immediately visible to the user. 

5. A lazy loading plugin or script can be used to implement lazy loading on a website. 

6. It is important to balance lazy loading with user experience, as users should not be left waiting too long for content to load. 

7. Lazy loading can also improve search engine optimization by reducing page load times and improving mobile performance, which can lead to higher rankings on search engines. 

8. It is important to ensure that lazy loaded content is still accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies or with slower internet connections. 

9. Lazy loading can also be used in combination with other optimization techniques, such as minification and caching, to further improve website performance. 

10. The implementation of lazy loading will vary depending on the specific website and its content, and may require some trial and error to find the optimal balance between loading speed and user experience.
