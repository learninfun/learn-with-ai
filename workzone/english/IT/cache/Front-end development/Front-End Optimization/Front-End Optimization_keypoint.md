1. Code optimization: Structuring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for faster loading and rendering times.

2. Minimizing HTTP requests: Using techniques such as CSS sprites, combining images, and inlining JavaScript to reduce the number of server requests required to load the site.

3. Utilizing browser caching: Setting long-term expires headers on static resources like images and CSS files to help the browser cache them and improve page loading times.

4. Leveraging content delivery networks (CDN): Using CDN to store static resources so web browsers can retrieve them from a CDN server closer to their location, improving page loading times.

5. Reducing third-party dependencies: Limiting the use of third-party plugins and scripts that can slow down page loading times.

6. Optimizing images: Compressing and reducing image sizes without sacrificing quality to reduce the time taken to load an image.

7. Implementing lazy loading: Delaying the loading of non-critical page elements until the user needs to see them, reducing the resources required to load the page.

8. Mobile optimization: Optimizing pages for mobile devices, adapting display resolution and image sizes, and using responsive web design. 

9. Tracking performance metrics: Monitoring and analyzing performance metrics such as page load times, time to first byte, and client-side rendering times to track the site's performance and continuously improve it.

10. User experience optimization: Incorporating user experience design principles to ensure website navigation, structure, and design are user-friendly to provide a smooth and seamless experience to visitors.
