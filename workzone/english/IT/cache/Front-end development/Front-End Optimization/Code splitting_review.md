1. What is code splitting?
Answer: Code splitting is a technique used in software development where large and complex applications are split into smaller and more manageable parts, making the software faster and more efficient.

2. What are the benefits of code splitting?
Answer: Code splitting can reduce the size of the application, ensure that only the necessary code is loaded, and improve the overall load time and performance of the application.

3. How does code splitting work?
Answer: Code splitting involves breaking down the application code into smaller chunks or modules, which can then be loaded on demand as the user interacts with the application. This helps to reduce the initial load time and improve the overall performance of the application.

4. What are some popular tools for code splitting?
Answer: Some popular tools for code splitting include Webpack, Rollup, and Parcel. These tools automate the process of splitting the code into smaller chunks and loading them on demand.

5. What are some common challenges and considerations when implementing code splitting?
Answer: Developers need to carefully consider the dependencies between the different modules, as well as the potential impact on the user experience if certain code is not loaded immediately. Additionally, there may be some extra configuration and overhead involved in setting up the code splitting process, which can add complexity to the development process.
