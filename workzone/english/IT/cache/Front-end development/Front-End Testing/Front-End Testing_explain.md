Front-end testing is a type of testing that verifies the functionality, behavior, and interaction of the user interface, including elements such as layout, typography, color, and responsiveness. This type of testing is typically performed by UI and UX designers, and quality assurance testers who ensure that the web application or software meets the user's expectations and is user-friendly.

An example of front-end testing can be testing the graphical user interface of a website or an application, including the navigation menu, different browser compatibility, mobile devices optimization, checking the layout of the webpage, images, animations or videos, etc. It involves checking the functionality of the website or application, and ensuring that the user interface components work seamlessly and consistently across different platforms. This type of testing is crucial for any web application or software, as it directly impacts the user experience and, ultimately, the success of the product.
