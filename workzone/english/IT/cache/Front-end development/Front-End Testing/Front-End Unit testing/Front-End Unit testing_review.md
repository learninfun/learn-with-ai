1. Q: What is a common method used for Front-End unit testing?
   A: One common method used for Front-End unit testing is the use of automated testing tools such as Jest.

2. Q: What is the purpose of Front-End unit testing?
   A: The purpose of Front-End unit testing is to test individual units of code in isolation to ensure they work as expected and do not cause unintended consequences to other parts of the codebase.

3. Q: What types of errors can Front-End unit testing help identify and prevent?
   A: Front-End unit testing can help identify syntax errors, logical errors, and functional errors in the codebase.

4. Q: What does the DOM (Document Object Model) have to do with Front-End unit testing?
   A: The DOM is a crucial aspect of Front-End unit testing because it is responsible for rendering the HTML and CSS that makes up the user interface. Unit tests can be conducted on DOM elements to ensure they are rendering properly and functioning as expected.

5. Q: When should Front-End unit testing be implemented in the development process?
   A: Front-End unit testing should be implemented as early in the development process as possible to catch errors as soon as they are introduced and prevent them from affecting other parts of the code. It should also be conducted after major changes are made to ensure that everything still functions properly.
