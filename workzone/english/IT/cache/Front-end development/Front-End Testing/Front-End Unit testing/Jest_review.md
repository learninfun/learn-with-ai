1) What is Jest and what is its primary use case?
Answer: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework that is primarily used for unit testing and for creating automated tests for web applications.

2) How does Jest differ from other testing frameworks?
Answer: Jest has several unique features, including its ability to perform snapshot testing, mock functions, and parallelization.

3) What is snapshot testing in Jest?
Answer: Snapshot testing in Jest is a feature that allows developers to create “snapshots” of their code output and compare them to the current output of their code. This helps to identify and prevent unintended changes to code output.

4) How can Jest be used to test React components?
Answer: Jest can be used to test React components by creating a test file with one or more test cases that make assertions about the component’s behavior or output. The test file is run using Jest’s testing environment, which can simulate user interactions and component states.

5) How can Jest be configured to meet specific testing requirements?
Answer: Jest provides a wide range of configuration options that can be used to customize its behavior for specific testing requirements. These include options for coverage reporting, test file patterns, test environments, and mocking options. The Jest configuration file, jest.config.js, can be used to specify these options.
