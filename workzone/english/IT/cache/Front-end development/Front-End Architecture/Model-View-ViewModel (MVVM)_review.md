1. What is MVVM?
Answer: MVVM is a software architectural pattern that separates the user interface (View) from the business logic (Model) by introducing a mediator component called ViewModel.

2. What is the role of ViewModel in MVVM?
Answer: The ViewModel acts as a mediator between the View and the Model. It provides the View with a set of properties and commands that the View can bind to, and it also communicates with the Model to fetch or update the data.

3. What are the benefits of using MVVM?
Answer: Some benefits of using MVVM include better separation of concerns, easier testing, improved code maintainability, and increased flexibility for the user interface.

4. How is data binding implemented in MVVM?
Answer: Data binding in MVVM is typically implemented using a data binding engine such as WPF's data binding engine or Xamarin Forms data binding engine. The View binds to the ViewModel's properties, which in turn communicates with the Model to retrieve or update data.

5. What is the difference between two-way and one-way data binding in MVVM?
Answer: One-way data binding in MVVM allows the View to display data from the ViewModel, but changes in the View are not reflected back to the ViewModel. Two-way data binding allows changes made in the View to be automatically updated in the ViewModel, and vice versa.
