Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is a design pattern widely used in software development. It is a variation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern and is often used with user interfaces. MVVM is designed to enhance separation of concerns and increase the testability of an application.

The three components of MVVM are:
- Model: It represents the data and the business logic of the application. This is the component that interacts with the database or any external services.
- View: It represents the user interface of the application. The view is responsible for presenting the data that is provided by the ViewModel in a way that is appropriate for the user.
- ViewModel: It acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. The ViewModel transforms the data from the Model to the format that the View expects. It also provides the data that is displayed in the View, and handles user input and interaction.

Example:
Let's say you are building a mobile application that shows weather information. The MVVM architecture for the application would look like this:
- Model: It represents the weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc. 
- View: It displays the weather information to the user. The user can see the current weather and also forecast for the next few days.
- ViewModel: It retrieves weather data from the Model and transforms it into a format that the View can understand. It also handles user input, such as selecting a city or date, and updates the Model and View accordingly.

In this example, the ViewModel acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. It retrieves the weather data from the Model and transforms it into a format that the View can understand. This separation of concerns enables the application to be developed and maintained easily.
