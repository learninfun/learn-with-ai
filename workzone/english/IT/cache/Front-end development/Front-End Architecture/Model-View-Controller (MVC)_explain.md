MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a software architectural design for implementing user interfaces that divide an application into three interconnected parts i.e. models, views, and controllers. Each component addresses a specific set of tasks, allowing for efficient collaboration during development. Here is the explanation of each component:

1. Model: This component represents the data and business logic of the application. It is responsible for managing and storing data and providing an interface for the user to interact with the data.

Example: In an e-commerce website, the product catalog, inventory management, and pricing information would be part of the model.

2. View: This component is responsible for the presentation of the data. It provides a user interface for the user to interact with the application and display data either in a browser or a desktop application.

Example: The user interface of the e-commerce website is part of the view.

3. Controller: This component receives user input and manages the interaction between the model and the view. It is responsible for updating the model based on the user input and updating the view to reflect changes in the data.

Example: In the e-commerce website, the shopping cart, ordering process, and payment gateway would be part of the controller.

Overall, MVC helps to separate concerns in the development of an application by breaking it into three parts: Model, View, and Controller. This separation allows developers to work more efficiently and make changes in one area without affecting others.
