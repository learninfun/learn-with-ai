1. Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is an architectural pattern that separates the graphical user interface (View) and the business logic (Model) in an application, and connects them via a ViewModel layer.

2. The Model represents the data and logic of the application, while the View is responsible for the presentation of the data to the user.

3. The ViewModel acts as a mediator between the Model and the View, abstracting the business logic from the presentation logic, and providing a clean separation of concerns.

4. The ViewModel exposes the relevant data and operations to the View via data binding, commands, and properties. It also communicates with the Model to fetch and update data.

5. MVVM promotes testability, reusability, and maintainability, as it enables developers to create modular and loosely coupled components that can be tested independently.

6. MVVM is a popular pattern for building modern cross-platform applications using popular frameworks such as WPF, Xamarin, and AngularJS. 

7. The MVVM pattern also supports separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability in large projects.
