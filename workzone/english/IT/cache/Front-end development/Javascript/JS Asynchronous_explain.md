JavaScript asynchronous programming refers to the ability of the code to execute discrete functions without disrupting the order of execution. It means that the execution doesn't wait for the long-running code to complete, which could slow down the program.

For example, imagine that the code has to call a web service to retrieve some user data. A traditional way of doing that by using synchronous code would involve the code waiting for the web service to respond before it continues to execute other tasks. However, this may cause the application to appear unresponsive, and the user may not be able to interact with the application while the network call executes.

In contrast, asynchronous code employs techniques such as callbacks, promises, and async/await, to ensure that long-running tasks are executed in the background without blocking the program's execution. The code can execute other tasks while waiting for the web service to respond.

Here's an example of asynchronous code:

```
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

In this example, the fetch function makes an HTTP request to fetch data from a REST API endpoint. Because this is an asynchronous operation, it returns a Promise object, which is then handled by the chained `.then()` method. Once the API response is received, the code logs the data to the console. If an error occurs, the `.catch()` method handles it. 

The code execution continues to proceed without waiting for the API response. By using asynchronous techniques like Promises, the code can execute other tasks while waiting for the API response, resulting in faster and more responsive applications.
