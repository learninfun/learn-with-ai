Programming

1. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in JavaScript?
Answer: Synchronous programming blocks the execution of code until a particular process is complete, while asynchronous programming allows multiple processes to run simultaneously without blocking the main thread.

2. What are callbacks in JavaScript?
Answer: Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to another function and are executed when the main function completes its task.

3. How do you handle errors in asynchronous programming?
Answer: One approach is to use try-catch blocks to handle errors that occur within the asynchronous function. Another approach is to use the .catch() method to handle errors that occur within a promise.

4. What are promises in JavaScript, and how do they work?
Answer: Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of a asynchronous operation. They have three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. Promises are created with the new Promise() constructor, and they use the .then() method to handle successful outcomes and the .catch() method to handle errors.

5. How does the async/await syntax simplify asynchronous programming in JavaScript?
Answer: The async/await syntax allows developers to write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code. The async keyword is placed before a function declaration to indicate that it contains asynchronous operations, and the await keyword is used to wait for a promise to resolve before proceeding with the next line of code.
