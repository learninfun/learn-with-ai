1. What is a prototype?
Answer: A prototype is an early model or sample of a product, service, or system, used to test and refine its design before production.

2. Why are prototypes important in product design?
Answer: Prototypes are important because they provide designers with valuable feedback about the practicality, usability, and effectiveness of their ideas. They help to identify potential flaws or design issues early on, which can save time and money in the long run.

3. What are some common types of prototypes?
Answer: Some common types of prototypes include: mockups, sketches, wireframes, breadboards, 3D-printed models, and functional prototypes.

4. How do you know when to create a prototype?
Answer: You should create a prototype when you have a clear idea or concept for a product or service, and you want to test its feasibility, functionality, and user experience. Prototyping is especially useful when you are working on a complex or innovative design.

5. What are some best practices for prototyping?
Answer: Some best practices for prototyping include: starting with a clear concept and design goals, involving stakeholders and users in the prototyping process, testing and refining the prototype iteratively, using low-fidelity prototypes for early validation and high-fidelity prototypes for final testing, and documenting the prototyping process and outcomes for future reference.
