1. What is a front-end performance budget?
Answer: A front-end performance budget is a set of limitations on the size and number of page resources, such as images and scripts, that a website can load to achieve optimal performance.

2. What are the benefits of having a front-end performance budget?
Answer: A front-end performance budget helps to ensure that a website loads quickly and efficiently, which enhances end-user experience and improves search engine rankings. It also helps to reduce development and maintenance costs by focusing on only essential resources.

3. How do you determine what should be included in a front-end performance budget?
Answer: You should first identify what resources are critical for the website's functionality and end-user experience. Then, you need to analyze the size and load time of each resource and assess the impact they have on overall page speed. The budget should prioritize critical resources and limit the size and number of non-essential resources.

4. Can a front-end performance budget be modified over time?
Answer: Yes, a front-end performance budget can be modified as necessary based on changes in the website's design, content, or technology requirements. However, any adjustments should maintain a focus on achieving efficient load times and avoiding excessive resource usage.

5. What are some tools available to help implement and monitor a front-end performance budget?
Answer: There are many tools available, including Google Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, and WebPageTest, among others. These tools help identify performance issues, suggest optimizations, and monitor performance regularly to ensure the website stays within the budget limits.
