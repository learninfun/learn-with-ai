1. What is the purpose of load testing and how is it measured?
Answer: Load testing is used to measure how an application performs under different levels of user activity or traffic. It is measured by identifying the maximum number of users or requests that the application can handle before slowing down or crashing.

2. What is the difference between stress testing and load testing?
Answer: Stress testing is used to measure how an application performs under extreme or abnormal conditions, such as high traffic or limited resources. Load testing, on the other hand, measures how an application performs under normal or expected conditions.

3. What are some popular tools for performance testing?
Answer: Some popular tools for performance testing include JMeter, LoadRunner, Gatling, Apache Bench, and Siege.

4. What is the purpose of a performance testing framework?
Answer: A performance testing framework is used to provide a structured approach to testing an application's performance. It typically includes tools, templates, and guidelines to help testers design, execute, and analyze performance tests.

5. How can performance testing be integrated into the software development lifecycle?
Answer: Performance testing can be integrated into the software development lifecycle by conducting tests at various stages, such as during development, regression testing, and pre-production. It can also be automated to run continuously in the background, ensuring that any performance issues are promptly identified and addressed.
