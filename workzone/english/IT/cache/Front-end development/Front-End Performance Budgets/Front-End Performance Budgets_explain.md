Front-End Performance Budgets refer to setting limits on certain performance metrics that affect the user experience on a website or application. These limits are then used as a benchmark to ensure that the website loads quickly and efficiently for its users.

For example, a front-end performance budget may include a limit on the overall size of the webpage or limit on the number of HTTP requests made by the webpage. This ensures that the webpage loads quickly and users are not frustrated with slow loading times.

Another example is the use of a performance budget for images. A website may set a limit on the overall file size or resolution of images used on the site to ensure fast page load times. This can also include compressing images to reduce their file size while maintaining their quality.

By setting limits on certain performance metrics, front-end performance budgets allow developers to ensure that their website or application is optimized for speed and efficiency. This not only improves the user experience but also helps to boost website rankings and conversion rates.
