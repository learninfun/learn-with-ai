HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a standard markup language used to create and structure content on the internet. It is the foundation of web development and is used to build websites and web applications.

HTML uses various tags to define the structure and content of a webpage. These tags are organized in a tree-like structure, and each tag has its own purpose and function.

Here is an example of a simple HTML code that creates a basic webpage:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my webpage!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>List item 1</li>
      <li>List item 2</li>
      <li>List item 3</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

This code creates a webpage with a title, a heading, a paragraph of text, and an unordered list. The HTML tags used in this code are:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This tag declares the HTML version being used for the webpage.
- `<html>`: This tag indicates the start of an HTML document.
- `<head>`: This tag defines the head section of the webpage, which includes the title of the page.
- `<title>`: This tag defines the title of the webpage, which is displayed in the browser tab.
- `<body>`: This tag defines the body section of the webpage.
- `<h1>`: This tag defines a heading, with the number indicating the level of the heading (h1 being the largest).
- `<p>`: This tag defines a paragraph of text.
- `<ul>`: This tag defines an unordered list.
- `<li>`: This tag defines a list item within the unordered list.
