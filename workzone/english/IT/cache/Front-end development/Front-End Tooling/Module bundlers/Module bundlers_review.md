1. What is a module bundler, and what problem does it solve?
A module bundler is a tool that combines multiple modules or files into a single bundle that can be used in a web application. It solves the problem of managing dependencies between modules or files, by ensuring that all the required code is included in the bundle and eliminating the need for manual dependency management.

2. What is the difference between a bundler and a task runner?
A bundler is a tool that specifically focuses on managing dependencies between modules or files, while a task runner is a more general-purpose tool that can be used to automate a wide range of development tasks, such as compiling code, running tests, and deploying applications.

3. What are some popular module bundlers, and how do they compare?
Popular module bundlers include Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, and Browserify. Webpack is the most widely used bundler and offers the most flexibility in terms of customization, but can be complex to configure. Rollup is designed for building libraries and focuses on generating small, optimized bundles. Parcel is a zero-configuration bundler that aims to simplify the bundling process, but has limited customization options. Browserify is a simple and stable bundler that is easy to use, but is not as performant as some of the newer bundlers.

4. How does tree shaking work, and what are the benefits?
Tree shaking is a technique used by module bundlers to remove unused code from a bundle. It works by analyzing the code and identifying the parts that are never called or accessed. By removing this code, tree shaking can significantly reduce the size of a bundle, resulting in faster load times and improved performance.

5. What is code splitting, and how can it improve the performance of a web application?
Code splitting is a technique used by module bundlers to split a bundle into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand, rather than all at once. This can improve the performance of a web application by reducing the initial load time and allowing users to interact with the application faster. Additionally, code splitting can improve the caching and reuse of code, resulting in further performance improvements.
