1. What is Webpack and what does it do?
Answer: Webpack is a popular module bundler for JavaScript applications. It helps you manage and package all the dependencies and assets of your application in a more organized and optimized way.

2. What is the difference between a loader and a plugin in Webpack?
Answer: Loaders and plugins are both used in Webpack to process and transform the source code of your application. Loaders are used to handle specific file types (such as CSS or TypeScript), while plugins are used to perform more general tasks (such as optimizing code or adding new functionality to the build process).

3. What is tree-shaking in Webpack and how does it work?
Answer: Tree-shaking is a feature in Webpack that helps eliminate unused code from your final build. It does this by identifying and removing any code that is not being used or referenced by your application, resulting in a smaller and more efficient bundle size.

4. How do you split your Webpack bundle into multiple chunks?
Answer: Webpack allows you to split your application into multiple chunks or bundles, either manually or automatically. You can use the code-splitting feature of Webpack to create separate chunks for different parts of your application, such as vendor libraries, shared modules, and application code.

5. What are some common performance optimizations you can make in Webpack?
Answer: Some common performance optimizations in Webpack include using tree-shaking and code-splitting, minimizing and compressing your code, leveraging caching and lazy-loading, and optimizing your build configuration and dependencies. These optimizations can help improve the speed, size, and efficiency of your application.
