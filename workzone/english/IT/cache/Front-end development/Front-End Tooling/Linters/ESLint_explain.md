ESLint is a static code analysis tool that is used for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code. With ESLint, developers can detect errors and track code quality, ensuring that code conforms to the guidelines and best practices of the project. ESLint is considered to be extensible, and it supports customizable rules, which makes it easy for users to tailor features that best suit their projects.

An example of using ESLint is the detection of possible errors or bad practices in code. Errors may include the use of single quotes instead of double quotes consistently throughout the codebase or having too many nested function calls. ESLint can also detect bad practices like declaring variables outside their scope or leaving unused variables in the code.

ESLint can be installed globally as a command line tool or inside your coding editor as an extension/plugin. It helps improve code readability, maintainability, and quality, making it a popular tool among developers.
