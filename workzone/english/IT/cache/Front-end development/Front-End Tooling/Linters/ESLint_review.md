1. What is ESLint?
Ans: ESLint is an open-source JavaScript linting tool designed to identify and report errors, potential programming issues, and stylistic inconsistencies in code.

2. How does ESLint work?
Ans: ESLint works by parsing JavaScript source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST) and then applying rules that analyze the AST to identify any issues and report them to the developer.

3. What are some common rules that ESLint checks for?
Ans: ESLint has hundreds of built-in rules that can be customized for specific projects, but some common rules include enforcing the use of semicolons, disallowing unused variables, and requiring consistent indentation.

4. How can ESLint be integrated into a development workflow?
Ans: ESLint can be integrated into various development environments, including text editors, IDEs, and build scripts. Developers can configure ESLint to automatically run on code changes and trigger automated workflows like code formatting and deployment.

5. Can ESLint be used for non-JavaScript languages?
Ans: While ESLint is primarily used for linting JavaScript code, it can be extended to support other languages and syntaxes with the help of plugins and custom rules. For example, there are plugins available for linting JSX syntax used in React applications.
