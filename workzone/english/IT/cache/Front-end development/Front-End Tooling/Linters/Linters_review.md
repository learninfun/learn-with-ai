1. What is a linter, and what purpose does it serve in software development?
Answer: A linter is a tool used to analyze code for syntax errors, bugs, and formatting inconsistencies. It helps to enforce coding standards and improve code quality.

2. How does a linter differ from a compiler or interpreter?
Answer: While a compiler or interpreter converts code from one language to another, a linter doesn't change the code's logic or functionality. Rather, it focuses on identifying and correcting stylistic and structural issues in the codebase.

3. What is the advantage of using a linter over manual code review?
Answer: A linter can analyze code much faster and in a more consistent manner than a human reviewer. This allows developers to catch errors and maintain coding standards more consistently and at a larger scale.

4. What are some popular linters for commonly-used programming languages?
Answer: For JavaScript, ESLint and JSHint are popular linters; for Python, Pylint and Flake8 are commonly used; for Ruby, RuboCop and Hound are well-regarded; for Go, Golangci-lint and Go Vet are popular choices.

5. How can a linter be customized to suit a specific project's coding standards?
Answer: Linters can usually be configured through a range of settings, including flags, rules, and plugins. These can be changed or added to fit the specific requirements of a particular project or team. Additionally, some linters offer integration with version control systems, allowing customized settings to be applied across multiple development environments.
