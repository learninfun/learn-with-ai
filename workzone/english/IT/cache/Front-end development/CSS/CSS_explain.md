CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to define the look and formatting of a website. CSS is responsible for setting the size, color, font, and style of website elements such as text, images, and video. 

Here's an example of how CSS works to change the look of an HTML element:

In HTML, you might have a paragraph element that looks like this:

<p>Hello, World!</p>

If you want to make the text "Hello, World!" appear in bold, you can use CSS. Here's how:

p {
 font-weight: bold;
}

This CSS code targets the paragraph element (indicated by the "p" selector) and sets the font-weight property to bold. This means that all text within the paragraph element will now appear in a bold font.

Overall, CSS allows designers and developers to create visually engaging and aesthetically pleasing websites that are easy to navigate and use.
