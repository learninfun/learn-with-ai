1. What is Sass and how does it differ from CSS?
Answer: Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is used to write CSS. It differs from CSS in that it allows for the use of variables, nested selectors, mixins, and functions.

2. How do you install Sass on your computer?
Answer: Sass can be installed on a computer using a package manager such as npm or using a standalone installer. It can also be installed via command line using the command "gem install sass".

3. What are mixins in Sass?
Answer: Mixins in Sass are reusable blocks of code that can be included in other stylesheets. They are similar to functions in traditional programming languages, allowing developers to avoid repeating CSS code across multiple selectors.

4. How do you declare variables in Sass?
Answer: Variables in Sass are declared using the "$" symbol followed by the variable name and its value. For example, $primary-color: #1e88e5; would declare a variable called "primary-color" with the value "#1e88e5".

5. What is the difference between @import and @use in Sass?
Answer: @import is an older way of importing Sass modules, whereas @use is a newer syntax that encourages a more modular approach to stylesheets. @use allows for the selective import of specific members from a module, and also namespace the included members to avoid conflicts with other variables and mixins.
