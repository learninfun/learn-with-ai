Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a CSS pre-processing language that helps to simplify and organize the styles in a website. Sass allows developers to write CSS in a more efficient manner by using variables, mixins, nesting, and other features. 

For example, in CSS, we might have:

```
.container {
  width: 100%;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

.container h1 {
  font-size: 24px;
  line-height: 1.2;
}
```

Whereas in Sass, we could write:

```
$container-width: 100%;

.container {
  width: $container-width;
  margin: 0 auto;

  h1 {
    font-size: 24px;
    line-height: 1.2;
  }
}
```

In this example, we used a Sass variable to store the container width, then used it in the container class. We also used Sass nesting to target the h1 element that's within the container class. This makes our code more organized, easier to read, and more efficient to maintain.
