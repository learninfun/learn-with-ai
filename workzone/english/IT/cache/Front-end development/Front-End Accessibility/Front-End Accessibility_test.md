1. What is the purpose of alt text in images and how does it improve accessibility for individuals with visual impairments?

Answer: Alt text, or alternative text, is a description of an image within the HTML code that provides a textual equivalent of what the image represents. This is important for individuals who use screen readers or other assistive technologies to access content on the web. By including descriptive alt text, users with visual impairments can understand the context of the image and receive equal access to the information presented.

2. What is a color contrast ratio and why is it important for accessibility?

Answer: Color contrast ratio is a measure of the difference in brightness and hue between the text and background color on a web page. This is important for accessibility because it affects the legibility of text for individuals with visual impairments, such as color blindness or low vision. In general, a color contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 is recommended for text on a white background and 3:1 for larger text or text on a colored background.

3. What are the benefits of using HTML5 semantic elements for web accessibility?

Answer: HTML5 semantic elements, such as <nav>, <header>, and <footer>, have specific meanings and roles within a web page structure. By using these elements, developers can create more descriptive and organized web content that is easier for assistive technologies and search engines to interpret. This can improve the accessibility and usability of a website for all users.

4. How can keyboard-only navigation improve accessibility for individuals with motor impairments?

Answer: Keyboard-only navigation allows users to navigate and interact with a website using only the keyboard, without the need for a mouse or other pointing device. This is important for individuals with motor impairments, who may have difficulty using a mouse or touchpad. By ensuring that all interactive elements on a web page can be accessed and used via keyboard commands, developers can increase the accessibility and usability of their website for all users.

5. What is the purpose of focus indicators and how can they improve accessibility for keyboard users?

Answer: Focus indicators are visual cues, such as a highlighted outline or color change, that indicate which element on a web page is currently selected or in focus. This is important for keyboard users, who rely on visual feedback to navigate and interact with a website. By providing clear and consistent focus indicators for all interactive elements on a web page, developers can ensure that keyboard users can easily and effectively use their website, improving accessibility and usability for all users.
