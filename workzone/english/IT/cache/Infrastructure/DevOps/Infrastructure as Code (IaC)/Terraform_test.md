1. What is Terraform and what makes it different from other configuration management tools?
Ans: Terraform is an open-source tool that allows users to provision and manage infrastructure as code. Unlike other configuration management tools, Terraform focuses on infrastructure instead of servers or applications, and it supports a wide range of cloud providers and services.
2. What are the main components of Terraform and how do they work together?
Ans: The main components of Terraform are providers, resources, and state files. Providers are plugins that allow Terraform to communicate with cloud providers and services, resources define the infrastructure objects to be provisioned or managed, and state files keep track of the current state of the infrastructure.
3. How does Terraform apply changes to infrastructure?
Ans: Terraform uses a plan-and-apply workflow to apply changes to infrastructure. First, it generates a plan that shows the changes Terraform will make to the infrastructure. This plan can be reviewed before applying the changes. Once approved, the apply command is issued and Terraform makes the necessary changes to the infrastructure.
4. Can Terraform be used for on-premises infrastructure?
Ans: Yes, Terraform can be used for on-premises infrastructure as well as cloud infrastructure. Terraform has providers for many popular on-premises infrastructure platforms, and users can also write their own custom providers for unsupported platforms.
5. What are some best practices for using Terraform in a larger organization?
Ans: Some best practices for using Terraform in a larger organization include using version control to manage infrastructure code, using remote state storage to enable collaboration and avoid conflicts, and enforcing security and compliance policies through the use of standard templates and policies. Additionally, creating a standard architecture and naming conventions can help ensure consistency and ease of use across multiple teams and projects.
