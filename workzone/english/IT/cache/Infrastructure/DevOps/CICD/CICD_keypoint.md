1. Continuous Integration (CI): Involves automating the build and testing of code changes continuously, ensuring that the changes are validated and integrated into a shared repository.

2. Continuous Delivery (CD): Building on Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery encompasses the automation of the entire software release process, from the time a change in code is committed to monitoring and deploying the change to production environments.

3. Automated Testing: Automation of testing is a critical aspect of CI/CD, which ensures that new code changes do not cause defects or break existing functionality.

4. Version Control: CI/CD relies on version control systems, like Git, which enable multiple developers to work simultaneously on the same code base and monitor code changes effectively.

5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Involves automating the provisioning and configuration of infrastructure, enabling developers to rapidly create test environments and reproduce production environments.

6. Monitoring: Continuous Monitoring of applications, infrastructure, and deployment pipeline helps in identifying problems and addressing them promptly.

7. DevOps Culture: CI/CD relies on DevOps principles of collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement, which requires strong communication and coordination among different teams to achieve successful deployment.
