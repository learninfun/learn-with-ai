Configuration management is a process that ensures software, hardware, and system components are maintained, documented, and updated throughout their lifecycle. It allows organizations to keep track of changes, configurations, and relationships between components while providing a framework for streamlining development, testing, deployment, and maintenance processes.

For example, in software development, a configuration management strategy typically includes version control, bug tracking, document management, and build and release management. A developer can use version control tools like Git or SVN to manage changes to the source code during development. A configuration management tool like Puppet or Chef can be used for deployment and management of the production system environment. This ensures that changes are tracked and applied consistently across all environments, which improves the stability and reliability of the system.
