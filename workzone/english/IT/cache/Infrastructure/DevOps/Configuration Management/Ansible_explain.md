Ansible is an open-source automation tool that allows users to manage, configure and automate their IT infrastructure. It simplifies the process of deploying applications, managing networks, and configuring servers by using a simple, lightweight language that is easy to understand and learn.

An example of Ansible's use might be to automate the deployment of a web application. An IT team could use Ansible to set up servers, configure them, and install necessary software like a web server and database. Using Ansible playbooks, the team could define the desired state of the infrastructure and deploy changes to multiple servers at once. This allows for consistent and repeatable deployments, reduced human error, and faster time to market for new applications. Overall, Ansible offers a powerful and flexible automation solution for managing complex IT infrastructures.
