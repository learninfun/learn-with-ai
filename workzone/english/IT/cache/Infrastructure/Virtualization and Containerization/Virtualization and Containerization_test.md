1. What is the difference between virtualization and containerization?
Answer: Virtualization creates a virtualized environment for the guest operating system, while containerization shares the host operating system with the containers.

2. What are the benefits of using virtualization?
Answer: Virtualization increases server utilization by allowing multiple operating systems to run on a single physical server. It also ensures high availability, facilitates disaster recovery, and reduces hardware and maintenance costs.

3. What is a container image?
Answer: A container image is a package that includes everything needed to run a container, such as the application code, libraries, and dependencies.

4. How does containerization differ from traditional application deployment?
Answer: Traditional application deployment involves installing the application and its dependencies onto a server, whereas containerization packages the application and dependencies into a container image that can be deployed and run on any host system.

5. What is Kubernetes, and how does it relate to containerization?
Answer: Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It enables a more efficient and streamlined approach to containerization by automating many of the tasks involved in deploying and managing containerized applications.
