Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It helps developers and DevOps teams to easily manage and deploy containerized applications at scale.

One example of using Kubernetes is deploying a microservices-based application. In this scenario, each microservice can be packaged into a container and deployed as a Kubernetes pod. Kubernetes can then automatically scale the number of pods based on demand, and manage traffic routing between them using services and load balancers. Kubernetes also provides health checks and self-healing capabilities, ensuring that the application is always available and running smoothly.
