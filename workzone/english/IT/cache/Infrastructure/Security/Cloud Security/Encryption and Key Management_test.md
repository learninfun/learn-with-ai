1. What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?

Answer: Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data, while asymmetric encryption uses a key pair, consisting of a public key to encrypt data and a private key to decrypt data.

2. What is a key escrow?

Answer: Key escrow is the process of storing a copy of encryption keys with a third-party, such as a government agency or trusted organization, for backup purposes or in case the original key is lost or compromised.

3. What is a digital signature?

Answer: A digital signature is a cryptographic method that guarantees the authenticity and integrity of a message or document by using a unique digital fingerprint, known as a hash, that is encrypted with the sender's private key.

4. What is key rotation?

Answer: Key rotation is the process of regularly changing encryption keys to mitigate the risk of key compromise or data breaches. This helps to ensure that encryption keys remain secure and effective over time.

5. What is a key management system?

Answer: A key management system is a software or hardware solution that enables organizations to securely generate, store, distribute, and manage encryption keys used for data protection. It includes tools for key lifecycle management, key storage, and key distribution.
