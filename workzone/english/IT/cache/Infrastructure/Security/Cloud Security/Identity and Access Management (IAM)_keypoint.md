1. Identification and authentication: IAM establishes a strong and reliable way to identify and authenticate the user's identity before granting access to resources or data. 

2. Authorization: IAM provides a way to specify which resources and data a user can access after authentication, ensuring that users only access what they should. 

3. User Management: IAM provides centralized management of user accounts, including creating, updating, and deleting accounts. 

4. Group Management: In IAM, groups of users can be created for better management of resources, allowing permissions to be assigned to groups, making it easier to manage access rights for multiple users simultaneously. 

5. Audit Trail: IAM logs all actions taken by users, ensuring accountability and compliance with regulations. 

6. Single sign-on (SSO): With SSO, users only need to enter their credentials once to access multiple applications. 

7. Password Management: IAM enforces password policies, such as complexity and expiration, to maintain account security.

8. Federation: IAM allows organizations to secure data access and sharing with other organizations or group members in a shared environment. 

9. Multi-factor authentication (MFA): IAM measures can go beyond traditional username and password protection to incorporate multiple physical tokens, biometric identification, or one-time verification codes making access secure. 

10. Access Reviews: IAM conducts regular access reviews to ensure the user's access remains in line with their changing roles and responsibilities within the organization, thus preventing them from accessing information they should not have access to.
