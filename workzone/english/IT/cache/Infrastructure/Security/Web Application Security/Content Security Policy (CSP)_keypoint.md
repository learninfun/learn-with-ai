1. CSP is a security feature implemented by web developers to prevent cross-site scripting attacks and other types of malicious code injection.

2. CSP works by defining a set of rules that dictate which types of content are allowed to be loaded and executed on a website.

3. By specifying an appropriate Content Security Policy, web developers can block certain types of content, such as inline scripts, inline styles, and external scripts, from loading on a webpage.

4. By doing so, they can minimize the risk of attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in these types of content.

5. CSP also allows web developers to define a "Report-Only" policy that logs all security violations without actually blocking any content. This can be useful for debugging and fine-tuning policies.

6. Overall, CSP is an important security feature that helps prevent a wide range of attacks, including cross-site scripting, clickjacking, and data injection.
