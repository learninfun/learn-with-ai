Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack in which an attacker forces a user to perform unwanted actions on a web application, such as transferring funds or changing passwords. The attacker accomplishes this by crafting a malicious link or script that the user clicks on, which sends a forged HTTP request to the web application with the user's authentication credentials.

For example, let's say a user is logged into their bank account and has the ability to transfer funds. The attacker could craft a malicious link and send it to the user via email or on a website. When the user clicks on the link, it sends a request to the bank's website that intentionally transfers funds from the user's account to the attacker's account without the user's consent or knowledge. Since the request is coming from the user's authenticated session, the bank's website will process the request as if it was legitimate. 

To prevent CSRF attacks, web developers can implement measures such as using tokens, checking headers, or requiring additional authentication steps.
