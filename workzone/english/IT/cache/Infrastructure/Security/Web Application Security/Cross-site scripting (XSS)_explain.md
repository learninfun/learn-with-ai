Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious code into a website that is then executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user who visits the site. This attack can allow the attacker to steal sensitive information, take control of the victim's browser, or execute unwanted actions on the user's behalf.

For example, imagine a user is visiting a popular shopping website and is presented with a search box. If an attacker were able to inject malicious code into the website, they could modify the search box to execute their own code when the user submits a search query. This could result in the attacker stealing the user's sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card information, or even taking over control of the user's computer.

A more specific example of an XSS attack could be a comment section in a blog. An attacker could input malicious content into the comment field, and when another user visits the blog, they could unknowingly execute the malicious code, which could potentially steal their personal information or cause their device to malfunction.
