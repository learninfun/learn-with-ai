Deep Q-Network (DQN) is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a neural network to learn the optimal Q-function, which is a mapping of state-action pairs to a value that represents the expected reward of taking that action in that state. DQN is a type of Q-learning algorithm that uses a deep neural network to estimate the Q-value function, which makes it suitable for handling high-dimensional state spaces such as images.

The main idea behind DQN is to use a neural network to approximate the Q-function, rather than store all possible Q-values in a lookup table. The network takes the current state as input and produces a vector of Q-values, one for each possible action. The action with the highest Q-value is then selected as the action to take. During training, the network is updated using a loss function that minimizes the difference between the predicted Q-value and the actual Q-value obtained by taking that action in that state.

One example of using DQN is in playing Atari games. The agent learns to play the game by observing the screen and taking actions that maximize the Q-value. The network is trained using a combination of experience replay, where previous experiences are randomly sampled and used to update the network, and target network, where the target Q-value is calculated using a separate network and is kept fixed for a certain number of iterations before being updated. This prevents the network from oscillating and helps it converge to a stable solution. With DQN, the agent is able to learn to play many Atari games at a superhuman level, surpassing the performance of human players.
