1) What is the main cause of global warming and climate change?
Answer: The main cause of global warming and climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2) from human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.

2) What is acid rain and how does it occur?
Answer: Acid rain is rainfall with a pH level below 5.6, caused by the emission of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from burning fossil fuels. These pollutants react with water in the atmosphere and produce acids that fall back to the Earth's surface as acid rain.

3) What are the effects of plastic pollution on marine life?
Answer: Plastic pollution can have a devastating impact on marine life, with animals often mistaking it for food or becoming entangled in it. Plastics can also release harmful chemicals into the water, affecting the health of marine ecosystems and potentially impacting human health as well.

4) What is the ozone layer and why is it important?
Answer: The ozone layer is a thin layer in the Earth's stratosphere that contains high concentrations of ozone (O3) molecules. It plays a crucial role in protecting life on Earth by absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun, which can cause skin cancer, cataracts, and other health problems.

5) What is the relationship between deforestation and climate change?
Answer: Deforestation contributes to climate change by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide that can be absorbed by trees and other vegetation. It also releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere through burning and decomposition of plant matter. Additionally, deforestation can disrupt local weather patterns and biodiversity, further contributing to the effects of climate change.
