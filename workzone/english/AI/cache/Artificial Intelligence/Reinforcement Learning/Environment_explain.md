Environment refers to the natural and human-made surroundings in which living organisms exist. It includes all living and non-living things in a particular area that affect the life of organisms living there. 

For example, a forest ecosystem is a natural environment consisting of various living organisms, such as plants, animals, and microbes, and their interaction with non-living elements of the surroundings, such as water, air, and soil. The forest provides habitat, shelter, food, and water to a variety of organisms, and the organisms contribute to the health and diversity of the forest ecosystem by carrying out various ecological functions, such as pollination, decomposition, nutrient cycling, and energy flow. However, human activities like deforestation, pollution, and climate change can have negative impacts on the forest ecosystem and the living organisms that depend on it.
