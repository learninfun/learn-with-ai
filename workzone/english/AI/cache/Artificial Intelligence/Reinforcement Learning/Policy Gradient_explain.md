Policy gradient is a reinforcement learning technique used to train agents to learn policies that allow them to maximize rewards in an environment. It involves calculating the gradients of the agent’s policy with respect to the expected rewards and using this gradient to update the policy parameters.

An example of policy gradient is training a robotic arm to reach a target in a 2D plane. The agent’s policy could be a neural network that takes the current position of the arm as input and outputs the action to take (i.e., move left, right, up, or down). The reward signal could be defined as the inverse of the Euclidean distance between the end-effector (tip of the robot arm) and the target.

During training, the agent would perform actions according to its current policy and receive feedback on how well it performed based on the reward signal. The policy gradient algorithm would then calculate the gradient of the expected reward with respect to the policy parameters, and update the parameters to increase the probability of the actions that lead to higher rewards. Over time, the agent would learn a policy that allows it to successfully reach the target in the 2D plane.
