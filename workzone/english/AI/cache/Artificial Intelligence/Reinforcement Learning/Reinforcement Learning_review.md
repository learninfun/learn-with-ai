1. What is the difference between reinforcement learning and supervised learning?
Answer: In supervised learning, the model is trained on labeled data, and the goal is to predict the correct output based on the input data. In reinforcement learning, the model learns by trial and error, receiving rewards or punishments for its actions, with the goal of maximizing its cumulative reward.

2. What is the difference between on-policy and off-policy reinforcement learning?
Answer: On-policy reinforcement learning involves learning from actions taken by the same policy that is being updated, while off-policy reinforcement learning involves learning from actions taken by a different policy.

3. What is the Bellman equation in reinforcement learning?
Answer: The Bellman equation is a recursive formula that expresses the value of a state as the sum of the immediate reward in that state plus the discounted value of the next state.

4. What are some common exploration methods in reinforcement learning?
Answer: Some common exploration methods in reinforcement learning include epsilon-greedy exploration, upper confidence bound (UCB) exploration, and Thompson sampling.

5. What is actor-critic reinforcement learning?
Answer: Actor-critic reinforcement learning is a type of model that employs both a policy (the actor) and a value function (the critic) to learn from its environment. The actor takes actions based on the policy, while the critic evaluates the value of those actions, giving feedback to the actor on how to improve its policy.
