Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. It involves the development of computer algorithms that enable machines to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, decision-making, and learning.

An example of AI is a virtual personal assistant like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant. These virtual assistants use natural language processing algorithms and machine learning techniques to understand and interpret user requests and provide relevant responses. They can help users with various tasks such as setting up alarms, making phone calls, sending messages, checking weather updates, and much more. These virtual personal assistants continuously learn from the data they receive and improve their performance over time, providing a personalized experience to each user.
