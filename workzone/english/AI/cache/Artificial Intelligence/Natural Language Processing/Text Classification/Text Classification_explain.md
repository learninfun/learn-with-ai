Text classification is a technique used to classify or categorize text documents based on their content. It involves training a machine learning model to recognize patterns in the text and then using that model to classify new documents into predetermined categories.

For example, let's say we have a set of customer reviews for a shopping website. We want to classify these reviews into different categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. We would begin by selecting a set of features or keywords that can help distinguish between these categories, such as words like "great", "disappointing", or "average". We would then train a machine learning model using these features and a set of labeled data (reviews that have already been categorized). Once the model is trained, we could use it to classify new reviews as they come in, helping the website quickly identify which products are performing well and which ones might need improvement.
