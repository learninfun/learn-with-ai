1. SVMs are supervised learning models that can analyze data and classify it into different categories.
2. SVMs work by identifying the optimal separating hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the two classes of data.
3. The margin is the distance between the decision boundary and the closest data points from each class.
4. SVMs can work with both linear and non-linear data.
5. The kernel function in SVMs transforms the data into higher-dimensional space, enabling it to find higher-dimensional hyperplanes.
6. SVMs can handle high-dimensional data and can avoid overfitting.
7. SVMs have been effective in solving real-world problems such as image and text classification, fraud detection, and biological classification.
