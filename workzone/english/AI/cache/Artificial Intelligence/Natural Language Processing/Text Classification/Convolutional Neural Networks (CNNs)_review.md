1. What is the purpose of pooling layers in a CNN?
Answer: Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the input, which helps to reduce overfitting and computational complexity.

2. What is the difference between convolutional layers and fully connected layers in a CNN?
Answer: Convolutional layers perform convolutional operations on the input data to extract features, while fully connected layers use these extracted features to classify the input.

3. What is the role of activation functions in a CNN?
Answer: Activation functions introduce nonlinearity into the output of a neuron, allowing the network to learn more complex features and relationships in the input data.

4. What is data augmentation in the context of CNNs?
Answer: Data augmentation is the process of generating new training data by applying transformations such as rotation or scaling to the original data. This helps to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the CNN's ability to generalize to new inputs.

5. What is transfer learning in the context of CNNs?
Answer: Transfer learning is the process of using a pre-trained CNN that has already learned features on a large dataset as a starting point for a new task. This can help to reduce the amount of training data needed and improve the accuracy of the new model.
