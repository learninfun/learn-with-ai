1. What are the main differences between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other types of neural networks?
2. How are convolutional layers used in CNNs to extract important features from images or other types of input data?
3. How do pooling layers help to reduce the size of the feature maps in a CNN, and why is this important?
4. What are some common ways to regularize CNNs to prevent overfitting, and how effective are they?
5. What are some applications of CNNs beyond image classification, and how do these applications leverage the unique properties of CNNs?
