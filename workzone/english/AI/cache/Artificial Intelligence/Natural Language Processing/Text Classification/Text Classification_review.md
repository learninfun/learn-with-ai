1. What is text classification and how does it work?

Answer: Text classification is a process of categorizing or labeling textual data based on specific criteria, such as subject matter or genre. It works through the use of machine learning algorithms that analyze the content of the text and assign it to one or more pre-defined categories.

2. What are some common techniques used for text classification?

Answer: Some common techniques used for text classification include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks. These techniques are used to train the machine learning algorithms to recognize patterns in the text data and classify it accordingly.

3. What are some challenges faced when performing text classification?

Answer: Some challenges faced when performing text classification include dealing with noisy data, handling the large amount of data, dealing with synonymy and polysemy, and addressing issues of bias and fairness in the training data.

4. What are some applications of text classification?

Answer: Text classification has several applications, including sentiment analysis, spam filtering, topic modeling, language detection, and content recommendation.

5. How can one evaluate the performance of a text classification model?

Answer: One can evaluate the performance of a text classification model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve. These metrics are used to measure the performance of the model against a test dataset, and to compare the performance of different models.
