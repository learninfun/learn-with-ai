Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification and regression analysis. It works by finding the best hyperplane that separates the data into different classes. SVM is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data, and it is often used in applications such as image recognition, text classification, and bioinformatics.

The main idea behind SVM is to find a hyperplane that maximally separates the data into different classes. The hyperplane is chosen such that it maximizes the margin between the two classes. The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each class. This ensures that the SVM is robust to noise and can generalize well to unseen data.

An example of SVM can be the classification of emails into spam and non-spam categories. SVM can be trained on a large dataset of emails with labels indicating whether they are spam or not. The SVM algorithm will learn to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails by finding a hyperplane that best separates them. Once the SVM is trained, it can be used to classify new emails either as spam or non-spam by applying the learned hyperplane.
