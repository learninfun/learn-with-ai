1. What is the difference between logistic regression and linear regression?
Answer: Logistic regression is used to predict a binary outcome (such as yes or no), while linear regression is used to predict a continuous outcome (such as a numeric value).

2. How do you interpret the coefficients in a logistic regression model?
Answer: The coefficients in a logistic regression model represent the change in log odds of the response variable for a one-unit change in the predictor variable.

3. What is the purpose of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in logistic regression?
Answer: The ROC curve is used to evaluate the performance of a logistic regression model by showing the tradeoff between sensitivity (the ability to correctly identify positive cases) and specificity (the ability to correctly identify negative cases) for different classification thresholds.

4. How do you handle multicollinearity in logistic regression?
Answer: Multicollinearity (high correlation between predictor variables) can make it difficult to interpret the coefficients and can lead to unstable estimates. One approach to handle multicollinearity is to use regularization techniques such as lasso or ridge regression.

5. How do you assess the goodness of fit of a logistic regression model?
Answer: There are different ways to assess the goodness of fit of a logistic regression model, such as the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, the Akaike information criterion (AIC), or the area under the ROC curve (AUC). These methods help to determine whether the model fits the data well and whether it is useful for predicting the outcome of interest.
