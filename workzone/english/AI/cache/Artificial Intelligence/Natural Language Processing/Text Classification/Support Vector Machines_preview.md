1. What is the basic concept and principle behind Support Vector Machines (SVM)? 
2. How do SVMs differ from other classification techniques, such as decision trees and logistic regression? 
3. Can SVMs handle both binary and multiclass classification problems? 
4. What are the different types of SVM kernels and when is each type best suited for a particular problem? 
5. How does SVM deal with outliers and noisy data in the training set?
