Logistic Regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there is one dependent variable that is binary (either 0 or 1) and one or more independent variables that can be continuous, discrete, or categorical. The aim of logistic regression is to find the best fitting model to describe the relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables by estimating the probability of occurrence of the dependent variable given the values of the independent variables.

One example of logistic regression is predicting whether a customer will purchase a product based on their age, gender, and income. In this scenario, the dependent variable is whether the customer makes a purchase or not (0 or 1). The independent variables are age, gender, and income, which can be continuous or categorical data. The logistic regression model estimates the probability of a purchase given the values of the independent variables. For example, the model may predict that a customer with age over 40, male, and income over $80,000 is likely to make a purchase with a probability of 0.8. This information can be used by businesses to target specific customer segments and improve their marketing strategies.
