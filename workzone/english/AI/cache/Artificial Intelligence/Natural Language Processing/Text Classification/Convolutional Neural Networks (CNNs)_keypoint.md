1. CNNs are a type of neural network designed for image and video processing.

2. They use convolutional layers to extract features from input images.

3. Convolution involves sliding a filter over an image to generate features.

4. Pooling layers are used to reduce spatial dimensionality and improve computational efficiency.

5. CNNs use non-linear activation functions to add non-linearity to the model.

6. Dropout is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting.

7. CNNs often use pre-trained models to transfer learning to new tasks.

8. CNNs have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a variety of image and video processing tasks, including object recognition, semantic segmentation, and facial recognition. 

9. CNNs have also been used in natural language processing applications.
