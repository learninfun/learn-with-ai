1. What is the main advantage of Support Vector Machines over other classification algorithms?
Answer: The main advantage of Support Vector Machines is their ability to handle non-linearly separable data using kernel functions.

2. What is the purpose of the hyperplane in the SVM algorithm?
Answer: The hyperplane in the SVM algorithm is used to separate the input data into different classes.

3. How does the regularization parameter in SVM affect the classification results?
Answer: The regularization parameter in SVM controls the balance between maximizing the margin and minimizing the misclassification error. A higher value of the regularization parameter can lead to overfitting, while a lower value can lead to underfitting.

4. What is the role of support vectors in SVM?
Answer: Support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary (hyperplane) and support the definition of the boundary. They are used to optimize the margin between the two classes.

5. What is a kernel function in SVM and how does it work?
Answer: A kernel function in SVM is a mapping of the input data into a higher dimensional space where the data may become more separable. SVM uses kernel functions to transform the original input data into a feature space where a linear decision boundary can effectively classify the data.
