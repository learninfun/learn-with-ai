Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) is a probabilistic model used for supervised learning tasks in machine learning. It is specially designed for structured output prediction and primarily used in natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition.

In CRFs, the goal is to predict a label sequence for a given input sequence. The model takes into account the context of the input sequence and learns from the correlations between adjacent labels. It considers the Markov assumption, which states that the probability of a label in a sequence is only dependent on the previous state.

An example of CRF can be part-of-speech tagging, where the task is to label each word in a sentence with its corresponding part of speech. In this case, given a sequence of words as input, the model predicts a sequence of part-of-speech tags. The CRF model considers the context of the surrounding words to predict the part-of-speech tag of a word, taking into account the dependencies between the adjacent tags. For example, given the sentence "The cat sat on the mat," the model would predict the sequence of part-of-speech tags as "determiner noun verb preposition determiner noun."
