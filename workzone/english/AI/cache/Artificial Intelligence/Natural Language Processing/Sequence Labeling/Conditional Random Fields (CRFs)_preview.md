1. What are the key differences between Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and other popular sequence labeling models, such as Hidden Markov Models and Maximum Entropy Markov Models?

2. What are some common applications of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) in natural language processing, computer vision, and other fields?

3. How do Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) account for dependencies between adjacent output variables, and how does this affect the accuracy of the model?

4. What types of features can be used in a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model, and how are these features typically integrated into the model?

5. What are some of the primary challenges associated with training and optimizing Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) on large-scale datasets, and what strategies can be used to overcome these challenges?
