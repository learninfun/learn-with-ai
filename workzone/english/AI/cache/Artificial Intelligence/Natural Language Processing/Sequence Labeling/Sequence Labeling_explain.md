Sequence labeling is a natural language processing task that involves assigning a label or category to each individual word or token in a sequence. 

For example, in the sentence "The cat jumped over the fence", sequence labeling would involve assigning labels to each word, such as "article" for "The", "noun" for "cat", "verb" for "jumped", "adposition" for "over", "article" for "the", and "noun" for "fence".

Sequence labeling is commonly used in various applications, such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, sentiment analysis, and speech recognition.
