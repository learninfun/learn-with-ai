Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are statistical models used to predict a sequence of unknown variables (hidden states) based on a sequence of observed variables. 

HMMs consist of two types of variables: hidden states and observed states. The hidden states cannot be directly observed but can be inferred based on the observed states. The observed states are the observable data points that are used to infer the hidden states.

HMMs operate based on the assumption that the probability of observing an observed state depends on the hidden state. HMMs are useful in a variety of applications, such as speech recognition, bioinformatics, and natural language processing.

An example of HMM usage would be in language recognition. A machine learning model can be trained using HMMs to recognize different languages. The hidden states in the model could represent different languages while the observed states could represent the sounds of different words. The model could be used to determine the most likely language based on the sequence of observed states. For instance, if the model receives the sequence of sounds "hola," it could calculate that it is most likely a Spanish language sequence.
