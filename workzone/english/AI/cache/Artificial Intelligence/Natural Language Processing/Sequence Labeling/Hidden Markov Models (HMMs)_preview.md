1. What is the basic idea behind Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)?
2. How are HMMs trained and how does the Baum-Welch algorithm work?
3. How can HMMs be used for speech recognition and what are some of the challenges?
4. How do HMMs compare to other machine learning models such as neural networks and decision trees?
5. How can HMMs be applied in bioinformatics, such as for protein structure prediction or genome annotation?
