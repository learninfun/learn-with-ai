1. How do Conditional Random Fields differ from Hidden Markov Models?
Answer: CRFs and HMMs are both used to model sequential data, but CRFs allow for more complex and flexible models by incorporating additional features and allowing for non-Markovian dependencies.

2. What is the objective function optimized during training of a CRF?
Answer: The objective function for a CRF is typically the log-likelihood of the training data, which is maximized using gradient descent or other optimization algorithms.

3. How are feature functions defined in a CRF model?
Answer: Feature functions in CRFs represent the relationship between a particular feature and the output labels, and are typically defined using binary indicator functions that take on a value of 1 if the feature is present and the label is correct, and 0 otherwise.

4. What is the role of the Viterbi algorithm in CRFs?
Answer: The Viterbi algorithm is used in CRFs to efficiently compute the most probable sequence of output labels given the observed input data, and is often used during inference or decoding.

5. How can CRFs be applied in natural language processing tasks?
Answer: CRFs have been used in a variety of NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition, part of speech tagging, and sentiment analysis, by modeling the sequence of words or tokens in a text and predicting the appropriate label for each one.
