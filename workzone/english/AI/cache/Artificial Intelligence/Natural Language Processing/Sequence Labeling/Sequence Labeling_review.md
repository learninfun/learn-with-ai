1. What is Sequence Labeling?
Answer: Sequence Labeling is a technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and labeling specific segments or entities within a sequence of text.

2. What are some common examples of Sequence Labeling tasks?
Answer: Some common examples of Sequence Labeling tasks include Named Entity Recognition (NER), Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, and sentiment analysis.

3. What are some common algorithms used in Sequence Labeling?
Answer: Some common algorithms used in Sequence Labeling include Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Conditional Random Fields (CRF), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

4. How is accuracy measured in Sequence Labeling?
Answer: Accuracy in Sequence Labeling is typically measured using metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score. These metrics help evaluate the precision of the model's predictions, its sensitivity to true positives and true negatives, and the overall strength of the model's performance.

5. What are some challenges faced in Sequence Labeling?
Answer: Some challenges faced in Sequence Labeling include dealing with ambiguous or complex sentence structures, handling out-of-vocabulary words, and balancing the trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, training a Sequence Labeling model can require significant amounts of labeled data and computing resources.
