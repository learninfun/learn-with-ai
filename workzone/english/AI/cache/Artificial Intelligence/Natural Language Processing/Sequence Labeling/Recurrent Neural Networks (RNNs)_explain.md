Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of artificial neural network designed to process sequential data. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, which only process data in a single direction (from input to output), RNNs are able to store information about previous inputs and use it to influence future outputs.

One common application of RNNs is in natural language processing, where they are used to generate text or predict the next word in a sentence. For example, an RNN could be trained on a large corpus of English text and then used to generate new sentences based on the patterns it has learned. Here's an example of how this might work:

Input: "The quick brown fox"
RNN output: "jumped over the lazy dog."

In this example, the RNN has been trained to predict the word that comes next in a sentence based on the previous words. Given the input "The quick brown fox", the RNN has learned that the most likely next word is "jumped over the lazy dog". Of course, this is just a simple example â€“ in reality, RNNs can be much more complex and difficult to train. But by using recurrent connections to store information about previous inputs, they are able to better model sequential data than other types of neural networks.
