1. CRFs are a probabilistic graphical model used for structured prediction tasks.
2. They are commonly used in natural language processing, computer vision, and bioinformatics.
3. CRFs model the conditional probability of a sequence given the input features and a set of label assignments.
4. The model is trained by maximizing the likelihood of the training data.
5. CRFs use a set of features to capture the context and dependencies between labels in the sequence.
6. Inference in CRFs involves finding the most likely sequence of labels given the input features.
7. The output of CRFs can be used for tasks such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and object recognition.
