1. Word embedding models are computational models that map words to numerical vectors. 
2. These models are trained on large datasets using unsupervised learning algorithms. 
3. Word embeddings capture semantic relationships between words, allowing them to be used in various natural language processing tasks. 
4. They enable the representation of words in a continuous vector space, allowing for better language processing tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis. 
5. Word embeddings can be generated using different algorithms such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText. 
6. Word embeddings can be visualized using techniques such as t-SNE and PCA. 
7. Pre-trained word embeddings from popular models are available for use in different natural language processing tasks. 
8. Word embeddings have become a standard tool in natural language processing and are used in various applications such as language translation, content recommendation systems, and search engines.
