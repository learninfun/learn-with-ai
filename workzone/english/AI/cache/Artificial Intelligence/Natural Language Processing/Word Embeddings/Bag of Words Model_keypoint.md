1. Bag of Words Model is a representation technique used in Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval.
2. It transforms text data into numerical vectors by converting the entire text into a bag of individual words.
3. It represents each word as a separate dimension and each document as a vector of word frequencies.
4. It disregards grammar and word order, leading to the loss of contextual information.
5. The resulting vector can be used as input for various algorithms like classification, clustering, and topic modeling.
6. It is important to preprocess data by removing stop words, stemming, and lemmatizing before applying the Bag of Words Model.
7. It is computationally efficient and easy to implement.
8. It is widely used in applications such as sentiment analysis, spam filtering, and search engines.
