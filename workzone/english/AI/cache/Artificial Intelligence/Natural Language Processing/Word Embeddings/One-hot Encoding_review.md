1. What is One-hot Encoding?
Answer: One-hot Encoding is a technique that transforms categorical data into numerical data.

2. How does One-hot Encoding work?
Answer: One-hot Encoding works by creating a binary column for each category in a categorical variable. For each row in the dataset, only one column is assigned a value of 1, which represents the category the row belongs to.

3. When should One-hot Encoding be used?
Answer: One-hot Encoding should be used when a categorical variable has a limited number of distinct categories and the order of their values is not significant. It is useful for machine learning algorithms that work with numerical data.

4. What are the advantages of One-hot Encoding?
Answer: One-hot Encoding allows for categorical data to be used in machine learning models, which typically require numerical data. It preserves the information about the categories while avoiding the issue of assigning order to categories.

5. What are some potential drawbacks of One-hot Encoding?
Answer: One potential drawback of One-hot Encoding is that it can result in a large number of columns in the dataset if the categorical variable has many categories. This can negatively affect the performance of some machine learning algorithms. Additionally, One-hot Encoding can introduce multicollinearity among the predictor variables, which can cause issues in regression models.
