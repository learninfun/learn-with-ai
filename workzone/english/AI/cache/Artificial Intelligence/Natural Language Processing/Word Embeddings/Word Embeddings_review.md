1. What is a word embedding?
Answer: A word embedding is a technique used to map each word in a vocabulary to a vector in a high-dimensional space.

2. What is the purpose of word embeddings?
Answer: The purpose of word embeddings is to capture the semantic or contextual meaning of words, so that the words' relationships can be interpreted and used for natural language processing tasks.

3. How are word embeddings created?
Answer: Word embeddings are typically created using unsupervised machine learning algorithms like Word2Vec or GloVe, which learn to predict the likelihood of a word occurring in a given context based on its neighboring words.

4. How are word embeddings used in natural language processing?
Answer: Word embeddings can be used in natural language processing tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, and language translation, where the meaning of words and their relationships play an important role.

5. What are some challenges in using word embeddings?
Answer: Some challenges in using word embeddings include dealing with out-of-vocabulary words, handling polysemy (words with multiple meanings), and interpreting the relationships between words in the high-dimensional space.
