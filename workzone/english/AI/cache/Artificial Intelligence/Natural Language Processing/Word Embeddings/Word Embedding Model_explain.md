Word embedding is a technique used to represent words in a numerical format that can be understood and processed by machines. The model learns the relationships between words by analyzing large amounts of language data, such as text documents, and maps these relationships into a high-dimensional space.

One popular word embedding model is the Word2Vec, developed by Google. It uses a neural network to learn the relationships between words and represents them as vectors in a high-dimensional space. For example, in a Word2Vec model, the word ‘king’ might be represented as a vector that is close to the vectors for ‘queen’, ‘prince’, and ‘royal’.

The Word2Vec model can be used in various natural language processing applications, such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and information retrieval. It is an effective way to capture the meaning of words and understand the context in which they are used.
