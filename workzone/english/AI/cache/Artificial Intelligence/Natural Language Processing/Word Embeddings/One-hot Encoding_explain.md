One-hot encoding is a technique used to convert categorical data into a format that can be easily used for machine learning algorithms by representing each category as a binary vector of 0s and 1s.

For example, suppose we have a dataset of animals with a "species" column that contains three categories: cat, dog, and bird. To one-hot encode this data, we would create a binary vector for each category, with 1 indicating the presence of that category and 0 indicating the absence. The one-hot encoded data for each animal would look like this:

- Cat: [1, 0, 0]
- Dog: [0, 1, 0]
- Bird: [0, 0, 1]

Now we can easily use this data for machine learning algorithms, as each category is represented in a standardized format that can be compared and analyzed.
