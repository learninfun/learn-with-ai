Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of study that focuses on the interaction between humans and computers using natural language. This technology aims to help computers understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is useful and meaningful to users.

An example of NLP is language translation software that can translate text from one language to another. These systems use advanced algorithms and machine learning to understand the structure and meaning of sentences, so they can accurately translate messages between different languages. NLP also works to improve search engine results for the users.
