Feature extraction refers to the process of selecting and extracting relevant features from a larger dataset or sample of data. Features are characteristics or variables in the data that are believed to be important for understanding or predicting a particular outcome or phenomenon. Feature extraction is often used in machine learning and data analysis to reduce the complexity and dimensionality of a dataset, making it easier to visualize and analyze the relevant information.

For example, imagine a dataset of customer data for an online retailer. The dataset might include information about each customer's age, gender, location, purchase history, browsing behavior, and other variables. Feature extraction might involve selecting only the most important variables for understanding customer behavior, such as age, purchase history, and browsing behavior. This would allow the retailer to more effectively target their marketing and promotional campaigns to customers who are most likely to make future purchases.
