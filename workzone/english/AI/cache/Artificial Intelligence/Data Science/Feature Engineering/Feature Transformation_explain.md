Feature transformation is the process of transforming or modifying the features or variables in a dataset to make them more suitable or appropriate for analysis, modeling or prediction. It involves changing variables by applying mathematical functions, scaling, normalizing, logarithmic, exponential or polynomial transformations or any other techniques that make data more interpretable or useful.

For example, consider a dataset that includes temperature readings in Celsius, but the model requires temperature data in Fahrenheit. In this case, we can apply a feature transformation by multiplying each temperature reading by 1.8 and adding 32 (the formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit), so that the temperature data is now in the appropriate unit. This transformation can make the dataset more meaningful and useful for future modeling and analysis.
