Outlier detection and handling is the process of identifying data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the dataset and deciding how to handle them. Outliers can be caused by various factors such as measurement errors, data entry mistakes, or rare events.

One example of outlier detection and handling is in a dataset of income levels for a certain population. Suppose that the majority of the income levels fall between $20,000 and $150,000 per year, but there is one data point that shows an income level of $1,000,000 per year. This data point is clearly an outlier, and it may be due to a data entry mistake or a very rare event. In this case, the outlier can be handled in several ways:

1. Removing the outlier from the dataset: This approach simply removes the data point from the dataset, which may improve the accuracy of data analysis.

2. Replacing the outlier with a more appropriate value: This approach involves replacing the outlier with a value that is more representative of the dataset. For example, the outlier may be replaced with the average or median income level for the population.

3. Leaving the outlier in the dataset: This approach involves leaving the outlier in the dataset, but recognizing its significance and adjusting data analysis accordingly. For example, certain statistical methods may need to be adjusted to account for the presence of outliers in the dataset. 

Overall, outlier detection and handling is an important step in data analysis to avoid skewed results and ensure accurate conclusions are drawn from the data.
