Outlier Detection and Handling:

1. Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data.

2. Outliers can be caused by measurement error, data entry errors, or natural variation in the data.

3. Outliers can have a significant impact on statistical analyses, including measures of central tendency and variability.

4. Outlier detection involves identifying data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data, using statistical methods such as z-scores, box plots, or scatter plots.

5. Outlier handling involves deciding what to do with outliers once they have been identified, such as removing them from the data set, replacing them with a different value, or treating them as missing data.

6. It is important to use appropriate methods for outlier detection and handling to ensure that statistical analyses are accurate and reliable.

7. There are different approaches to outlier detection and handling depending on the specific data and analysis being performed, and the goals of the analysis.
