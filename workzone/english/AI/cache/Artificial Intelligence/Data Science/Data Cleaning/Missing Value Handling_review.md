1. What is the common technique for handling missing values in datasets?
Answer: Imputation is a common technique for handling missing values in datasets where missing values are replaced with estimated or predicted values.

2. What is the difference between missing completely at random (MCAR) and missing at random (MAR)?
Answer: Missing completely at random (MCAR) is where the missingness is unrelated to the values of the variable or to any other variables in the dataset, while missing at random (MAR) is where the missingness is related to other variables in the dataset.

3. What is multiple imputation?
Answer: Multiple imputation is a technique for handling missing values where multiple sets of imputed data are generated, and analysis is performed on each set of data. This technique accounts for the uncertainty in the imputed values and produces more accurate results.

4. What is mean imputation?
Answer: Mean imputation is a technique for handling missing values where the missing values are replaced by the mean of the non-missing values for that variable. This technique assumes that the missing values are randomly distributed across the dataset.

5. What is hot-deck imputation?
Answer: Hot-deck imputation is a technique for handling missing values where the missing values are replaced by the value from the nearest record in the dataset. This technique preserves the pattern of the data and is useful for datasets with a small number of missing values.
