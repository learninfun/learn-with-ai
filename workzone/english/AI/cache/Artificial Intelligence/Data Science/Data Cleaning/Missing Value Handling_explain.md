Missing value handling refers to the techniques applied to deal with missing data in a dataset. In statistical analysis, missing data can lead to biased results and inaccurate inferences. Therefore, it is important to deal with missing values before analyzing the dataset.

There are different techniques for handling missing values, including:

1. Deleting the missing values: This method involves removing incomplete observations from the dataset. However, this technique can result in a loss of important information and may skew the results.

2. Mean/Mode/Median Imputation: This method involves replacing missing values with the mean, mode or median value of the corresponding feature. However, this method assumes that the missing value is similar to the other values in the dataset, which may not always be true.

3. K-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation: This method involves estimating the missing values based on the values of their K nearest neighbors. This method can lead to more accurate results since it considers the values of similar observations.

4. Model-based imputation: This method involves building a model to estimate the missing values based on the relationship between the features in the dataset. This method can lead to highly accurate results if the model is well-trained.

Example: Suppose we have a dataset containing information about customers, including demographics, transaction history, and customer lifetime value. Some of the records are missing the customer lifetime value. To handle the missing values, we could use mean imputation and replace the missing values with the average customer lifetime value of the dataset. Alternatively, we could use KNN imputation and impute the missing values based on the values of the nearest customers with similar demographics and transaction history.
