Data cleaning, also known as data cleansing, is the process of identifying and correcting or removing inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and duplicates within a data set to improve data quality. 

For example, if we have a database of customer information for a company, some data cleaning steps may include:

1. Removing duplicates: If the same customer appears multiple times in the database, we can remove the duplicate entries to avoid confusion and maintain accuracy.
2. Correcting spelling errors: If a customer's name is misspelled as "Jhon" instead of "John," we can correct it to maintain consistency and accuracy.
3. Formatting: If dates or phone numbers are stored in inconsistent formats, we can standardize them to make it easier to analyze and use the data.
4. Filling missing values: If there are missing values, we can infer appropriate values based on other information available in the database or simply remove those entries if the missing data is too significant to infer. 

By cleaning the data, the company can ensure that the information in the database is accurate, consistent, and reliable for analysis and decision-making.
