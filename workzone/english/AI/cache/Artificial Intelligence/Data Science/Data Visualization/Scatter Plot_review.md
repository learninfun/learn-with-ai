1. What is the purpose of a scatter plot?
Answer: The purpose of a scatter plot is to show the relationship between two sets of data by plotting them as points on a graph.

2. What is correlation in a scatter plot?
Answer: Correlation in a scatter plot is the measure of how closely the points on the graph are clustered together. A strong correlation indicates a tight relationship between the two sets of data, while a weak correlation shows a less clear relationship.

3. What does the slope of a scatter plot line indicate?
Answer: The slope of a scatter plot line indicates the direction and magnitude of the relationship between the two sets of data. A positive slope shows a positive correlation, while a negative slope indicates a negative correlation.

4. How can you determine if a scatter plot shows a linear relationship?
Answer: A scatter plot shows a linear relationship if the points on the graph seem to form a straight line when connected. This indicates that the two sets of data are directly and proportionally related.

5. What is an outlier in a scatter plot?
Answer: An outlier in a scatter plot is a point that deviates significantly from the other points on the graph. These points may indicate errors in data collection or may show an unusual trend in the data.
