A scatter plot is a graphical representation of a series of data points. It is used to display the relationship between two sets of data. The data points are scattered on the plot, and each point represents an individual observation.

For example, let's say we want to analyze the relationship between a person's age and their income. We collect data from a sample of individuals and plot their age on the x-axis and their income on the y-axis. Each individual's data point is represented by a dot on the graph.

As we plot more and more data points, a pattern may emerge on the scatter plot. We may see that as age increases, income also tends to increase, indicating a positive relationship between age and income. Alternatively, we may see no apparent relationship between age and income, indicating that the two variables are not related.

Scatter plots are an important tool for analyzing and visualizing data, and they can help us to identify patterns and relationships among variables.
