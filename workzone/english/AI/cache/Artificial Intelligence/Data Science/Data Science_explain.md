Data Science is the study of how data is generated, managed, and analyzed using various techniques and tools to extract insights and knowledge from it. It involves the use of statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and other analytical tools to extract valuable information from complex and large datasets.

An example of Data Science is in the field of Healthcare. Healthcare organizations use data science to study health patterns and the impact of treatments on patient outcomes. For instance, data science can help in identifying patient groups with a high-risk profile and developing preventive measures to avoid hospital readmissions. By analyzing and combining data from various sources such as electronic health records, claims, and social determinants of health, healthcare professionals can identify the factors that influence disease outcomes and develop treatments that are tailored to individual patients. This can help improve health outcomes, reduce costs, and improve patient satisfaction.
