1. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in data science?
Answer: Supervised learning involves predicting outcomes based on labeled data, while unsupervised learning involves identifying patterns in unlabeled data.

2. What is the purpose of regularization in machine learning?
Answer: Regularization is used to prevent overfitting in models by adding a penalty term to the loss function.

3. What is the curse of dimensionality in data science?
Answer: The curse of dimensionality refers to the difficulty of analyzing data with many variables, as the amount of data required to adequately cover the space increases exponentially with each additional dimension.

4. What is K-means clustering?
Answer: K-means clustering is a method of unsupervised learning that attempts to partition a set of data points into K clusters based on similarity.

5. What is a decision tree in machine learning?
Answer: A decision tree is a model that uses a tree-like structure to represent a set of decisions and their possible consequences, allowing for the prediction of outcomes based on different input variables.
