1. What is Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and how does it differ from traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)?
2. How do LSTMs address the vanishing gradient problem often encountered in training RNNs?
3. What are the key components of an LSTM architecture and how do they operate together to perform sequence modeling tasks?
4. How can LSTMs be applied in natural language processing tasks such as language translation, sentiment analysis, and text generation?
5. What are some of the limitations and challenges associated with using LSTMs, such as overfitting and hyperparameter tuning?
