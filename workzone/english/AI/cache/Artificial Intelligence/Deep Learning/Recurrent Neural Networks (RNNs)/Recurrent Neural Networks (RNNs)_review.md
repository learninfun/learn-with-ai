1. How does an RNN differ from a regular feedforward neural network?

Answer: While a feedforward neural network takes in an input and passes it through hidden layers to produce an output, RNNs pass information from one timestep to the next, allowing them to handle sequences of variable length.

2. What is backpropagation through time in RNNs?

Answer: Backpropagation through time (BPTT) is a method for training RNNs that involves unrolling the network through time and applying backpropagation to the resulting graph structure. Essentially, BPTT is a way to extend the backpropagation algorithm used in feedforward neural networks to handle temporal dependencies between inputs and outputs.

3. What are some common problems associated with RNN training, and how can they be addressed?

Answer: Some common issues in RNN training include vanishing or exploding gradients, difficulty in storing long-term memory information, and overfitting to training data. These problems can be addressed by using techniques like gradient clipping, gating mechanisms (e.g. LSTM or GRU), and regularization methods such as dropout.

4. What is the difference between a one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many RNN architecture?

Answer: A one-to-one RNN takes a single input and produces a single output, similar to a feedforward neural network. A one-to-many RNN takes a single input and produces a sequence of outputs. A many-to-one RNN takes a sequence of inputs and produces a single output. A many-to-many RNN takes a sequence of inputs and produces a sequence of outputs.

5. What are some applications of RNNs?

Answer: RNNs have been used for a variety of tasks, including natural language processing (e.g. language modeling, machine translation, chatbots), image captioning, speech recognition, and even music generation. Because RNNs can handle sequences of variable length, they are especially useful for tasks that involve temporal dependencies.
