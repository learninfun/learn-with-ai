1. LSTM neural networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is able to retain long-term memory.

2. LSTMs achieve this by using a series of gates and memory cells that regulate the flow of information through the network.

3. The gates in LSTMs include the input gate, forget gate, and output gate. These gates control the flow of information into and out of the LSTM memory cells.

4. LSTMs also use an activation function known as the “memory cell” that enables the network to store information over extended periods of time.

5. The LSTM architecture is highly adaptable and can be used in a variety of applications, including natural language processing, image and speech recognition, and prediction models.

6. Training LSTMs can be computationally intensive, but there are several techniques available to optimize the training process.

7. LSTMs have achieved state-of-the-art results in many fields, making them an increasingly popular choice among machine learning practitioners.
