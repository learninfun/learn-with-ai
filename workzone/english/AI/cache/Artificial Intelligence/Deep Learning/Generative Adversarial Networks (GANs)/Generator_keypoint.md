1. A generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.
2. It operates on the principles of electromagnetic induction.
3. It consists of a rotor and a stator.
4. The rotor rotates within the stator, creating a magnetic field.
5. The magnetic field induces an electric current in the stator windings.
6. The induced current is then collected by slip rings or brushes and sent to an external circuit.
7. The output voltage and frequency can be controlled by adjusting the speed of the rotor or the number of windings in the stator.
8. Generators are used in various applications, such as power generation of electrical grids, backup power for buildings, and portable power sources for camping or outdoor activities.
