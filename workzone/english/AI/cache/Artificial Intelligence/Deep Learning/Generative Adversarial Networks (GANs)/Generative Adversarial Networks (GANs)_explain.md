Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of deep learning algorithm that consists of two neural networks - a generator and a discriminator - that work together to create and differentiate fake and real data. The generator is responsible for creating new data by trying to mimic a given dataset or distribution, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish between the generated data and the real data from the given dataset.

The two networks work in a cycle of training, with the generator trying to improve its ability to create data that is indistinguishable from the real data, while the discriminator tries to improve its ability to differentiate between the fake and real data. This cycle continues until both networks reach an equilibrium, at which point the generator is considered to have succeeded in creating data that is virtually identical to the real data.

A common application of GANs is in image synthesis, where the generator is trained on a set of real images and then used to create new images that are similar to the originals. For example, a GAN can be used to generate realistic-looking images of faces, even though the faces in the training dataset have different features, expressions, and backgrounds. Another example is using GANs to generate realistic textures for 3D models in video games or movies.
