Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that involves the use of neural networks with multiple hidden layers for processing and modelling complex data. The multi-layered architecture allows the network to learn complex representations of the input data and make more accurate predictions as the number of hidden layers increases.

An example of Deep Learning can be seen in image recognition systems such as facial recognition technology. These systems utilize multi-layered neural networks to recognize and differentiate between different objects within an image. As the network learns from multiple images, it can detect subtle variations in facial features, allowing it to accurately identify individuals even in challenging scenarios.

Other examples of deep learning include natural language processing, speech recognition, and predictive analytics. In all these cases, deep learning enables the system to learn from vast amounts of data to identify patterns and relationships that are not easily discernible by human intuition alone.   Overall, deep learning has the potential to revolutionize various fields from healthcare to finance to transportation by providing powerful tools for complex data analysis and prediction.
