1. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to model and solve complex problems.
2. It is inspired by the working of the human brain and aims to replicate its ability to learn from experience.
3. Deep learning algorithms can learn from large datasets and can automatically extract features that are relevant for the task at hand.
4. Deep learning can be supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised, depending on the availability of labeled data.
5. Deep learning has applications in a wide range of fields, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and robotics.
6. Training deep neural networks requires a large amount of computational resources, including powerful GPUs and specialized hardware like ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits).
7. Despite their complexity, deep learning models can make accurate predictions in real-time, making them suitable for real-world applications.
