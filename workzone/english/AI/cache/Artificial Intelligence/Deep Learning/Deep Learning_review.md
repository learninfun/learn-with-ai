1. What is the purpose of backpropagation in deep learning?
Answer: Backpropagation is used to adjust the weights of the neural network during the training process, in order to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual output.

2. What is a convolutional neural network (CNN) and how is it different from a regular neural network?
Answer: A CNN is a type of neural network that is designed for image recognition tasks. It uses filters to extract features from the input image, which are then processed by multiple layers to make the final prediction. A regular neural network does not have a specialized architecture for processing image data.

3. What is overfitting in deep learning, and how can it be avoided?
Answer: Overfitting occurs when a model becomes too complex and starts to fit the training data too closely, which can reduce its ability to generalize to new data. It can be avoided by using techniques such as dropout, early stopping, and regularization.

4. What is transfer learning, and how can it be used in deep learning?
Answer: Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model is used as a starting point for a new task. This can save time and resources compared to training a new model from scratch. The pre-trained model can be fine-tuned on the new data to improve its accuracy.

5. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in deep learning?
Answer: In supervised learning, the model is trained on labeled data, where the inputs and outputs are known. In unsupervised learning, the model is trained on unlabeled data, where the goal is to find patterns or structure in the data without explicit guidance.
