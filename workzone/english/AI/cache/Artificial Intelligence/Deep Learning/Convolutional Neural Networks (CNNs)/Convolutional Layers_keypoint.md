1. Convolutional layers are a key component of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

2. They are designed to extract features from input images by sliding a kernel or filter across the input data.

3. The kernel calculates the dot product of its weights with each corresponding subset of the input data.

4. The resulting convolved feature map highlights important features in the input data.

5. Convolutional layers can perform different types of operations, such as:

- Convolution: multiplying and summing the input data with the kernel. 
- Padding: adding zeros around the edges of the input data to preserve spatial dimensions. 
- Stride: the number of pixels by which the kernel is moved each time. 

6. Pooling layers are often used after convolutional layers to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.

7. Common types of pooling layers include max pooling and average pooling.

8. Convolutional layers generally contain multiple filters or kernels, allowing them to extract multiple features from the same input data.

9. Convolutional layers can be stacked to create deeper networks, which can learn more complex image features.

10. Convolutional layers are often followed by fully connected layers, which use the extracted features to predict the class of the input image.
