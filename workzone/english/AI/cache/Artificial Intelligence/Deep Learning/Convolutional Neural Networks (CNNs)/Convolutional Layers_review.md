1. What is the purpose of a convolutional layer in a convolutional neural network (CNN)?
Answer: A convolutional layer applies a filter to the input data to extract features, such as edges or textures, and reduces the spatial dimensions of the data.

2. What is a kernel or filter in a convolutional layer?
Answer: A kernel or filter is a set of weights that is applied to a small region of the input data in a convolutional layer.

3. How do convolutional layers differ from fully connected layers in a CNN?
Answer: Convolutional layers apply a filter to a local region of the input data, while fully connected layers apply a set of weights to the entire input. Additionally, convolutional layers typically have fewer parameters than fully connected layers, which can make them more efficient.

4. What is stride in a convolutional layer?
Answer: Stride is the amount by which the filter is shifted across the input data during the convolution operation. A larger stride results in a smaller output size, while a smaller stride results in a larger output size.

5. How does pooling improve the performance of a CNN?
Answer: Pooling reduces the spatial dimensions of the data by taking the maximum (max pooling) or average (average pooling) value in a local region. This reduces the amount of computation in the network and can help to prevent overfitting.
