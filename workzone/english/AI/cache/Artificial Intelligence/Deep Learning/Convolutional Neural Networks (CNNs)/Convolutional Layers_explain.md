Convolutional Layers are a key component of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) used for image and video recognition. They consist of a set of filters, which slide across an input image, perform dot products with the pixels in the image and produce a feature map as output.

The main idea of Convolutional Layers is to learn features of the image or video input through a convolution operation, which is essentially a weighted sum over a local region of the input data. This local region can be thought of as a receptive field, which corresponds to the filter size. By gradually increasing the number of filters, Convolutional Layers can capture increasingly complex features of the image.

For example, consider a Convolutional Layer with a 3x3 filter and stride of 1 applied to an input image of size 28x28x3. This means the filter will slide across the image with a stride of 1 and perform a dot product with a 3x3 region of the image at each position. The output feature map will have a size of 26x26x64, with 64 being the number of filters used in the layer. Each pixel in the output feature map represents the activation of a single filter at a specific location in the input image. The values in the feature map represent the strength of the activation and can be used to identify patterns and features of the original image.
