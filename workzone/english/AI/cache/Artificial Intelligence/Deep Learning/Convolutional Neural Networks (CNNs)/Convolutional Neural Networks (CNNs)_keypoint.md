1. CNNs are neural networks designed specifically for image recognition and classification tasks.
2. CNNs use a process called convolution to detect features in an image and subsequently classify it.
3. Convolution involves sliding a filter over the input image and performing a dot product to produce a feature map.
4. CNNs also use pooling to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps and increase computational efficiency.
5. The layers of a CNN typically include convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
6. CNNs can learn and adapt to new data through the use of backpropagation and optimization algorithms.
7. CNN architecture can vary depending on the specific task and input data, with common networks including VGG, ResNet, and Inception.
