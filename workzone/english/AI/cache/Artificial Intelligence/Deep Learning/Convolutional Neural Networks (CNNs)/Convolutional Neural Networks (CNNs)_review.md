1. What is the key role of convolutional layers in a CNN? 
Answer: Convolutional layers apply filters to the input image, enabling the network to capture local features and patterns.

2. What is pooling in CNNs, and how does it help in reducing dimensionality? 
Answer: Pooling refers to the process of down-sampling or reducing the spatial dimension of the feature maps in the network. It helps in reducing dimensionality and removing unwanted noise, making the network more efficient.

3. What is the difference between fully connected layers and convolutional layers in a CNN? 
Answer: Fully connected layers connect every neuron to every other neuron in the previous layer, whereas convolutional layers only connect neurons in specific local regions of the input.

4. What is backpropagation, and how is it used in training CNNs? 
Answer: Backpropagation is an algorithm used to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters of the network. It is used to adjust the weights in each layer during training, in order to minimize the loss function and improve the networkâ€™s performance.

5. How can pre-trained CNN models be used for transfer learning in computer vision tasks? 
Answer: Pre-trained CNN models are trained on large datasets of images and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, by using them as a starting point and fine-tuning the weights of the last few layers to achieve better performance on the target task. This approach is especially useful when working with limited datasets.
