Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of artificial neural network architecture that are designed to analyze and classify visual images. They are based on the principles of convolution, which is a mathematical operation that involves combining two functions to produce a third function that expresses how one of the original functions is modified by the other.

CNNs are composed of multiple layers, each of which performs a specific type of operation on the input image. The primary layers are convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Convolutional layers convolve the input image with a set of learnable filters, creating feature maps that represent specific image patterns. Pooling layers reduce the size of the feature maps, while maintaining the most important information. Fully connected layers classify the features into distinct classes.

An example of a CNN would be image recognition. Suppose we want to train a system to recognize images of cats and dogs. We would divide the training set of images into two classes - cat images and dog images. We would then use a CNN to learn the features that distinguish cats from dogs. The first layer of the CNN would apply a set of filters to the input image, extracting basic features such as edges and corners. The second layer would apply a second set of filters, extracting more complex features such as ears and whiskers. As we move deeper into the network, the features become increasingly specific to cats or dogs. Eventually, the CNN would identify the distinctive features of each class and classify new images as either cat or dog.
