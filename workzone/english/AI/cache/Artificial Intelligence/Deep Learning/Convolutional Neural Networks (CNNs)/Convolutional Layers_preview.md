1. What is the function of convolutional layers in a convolutional neural network?
2. How does the application of convolutional filters in a convolutional layer help identify features in an image?
3. What is the difference between a max pooling layer and a convolutional layer, and why might one be chosen over the other for a given task?
4. How do hyperparameter choices like kernel size and number of filters impact the performance of convolutional layers in a neural network?
5. Can convolutional layers be used for tasks beyond image classification, such as natural language processing or audio analysis, and if so, how?
