1. Pooling layers are part of neural networks typically used in computer vision applications.
2. The purpose of a pooling layer is to reduce the spatial dimensions (width and height) of a feature map, while preserving its depth.
3. The most common pooling operations are max pooling and average pooling, which select either the maximum or the average value from a rectangular neighborhood of the input.
4. Pooling layers introduce translational invariance to small spatial translations, by considering only the maximum or average value within a certain area of the input.
5. Pooling layers help to reduce the number of parameters, improve computational efficiency and prevent overfitting in neural networks. However, they may also cause loss of information and reduce the fidelity of the output.
