1. Activation functions are a crucial part of artificial neural networks.
2. They determine whether a neuron should be activated or not based on the input received.
3. The most commonly used activation functions are sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh.
4. Sigmoid functions are used for binary classification.
5. ReLU functions are used for deep learning models due to their ability to speed up computations.
6. Tanh functions are used for hidden layers in machine learning models.
7. Activation functions can be differentiated to facilitate backpropagation in neural networks.
8. Choosing the right activation function is critical for the success of machine learning models.
