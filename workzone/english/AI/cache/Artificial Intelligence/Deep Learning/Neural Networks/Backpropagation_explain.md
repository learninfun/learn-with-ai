Backpropagation is a method used in training neural networks to adjust the weights of the connections between neurons by calculating and propagating error signals through the network. It is a type of supervised learning, where the network is trained on a set of labeled data, i.e., data that already has the correct answer.

The backpropagation algorithm works by first performing a forward pass through the network, where the input data is fed through the neural network and produces a predicted output. The predicted output is then compared to the actual output, and the difference between them is calculated as the error. The error is then propagated backward through the network, starting from the output layer and moving backwards towards the input layer. At each layer, the error is split among the neurons based on their contribution to the output, and the weights of the connections between the neurons are adjusted proportionally to the error they contributed to.

Here is an example of backpropagation in action: Let's say we have a simple neural network with one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer, and we want to train it to classify handwritten digits. We start by feeding in an image of a digit, which is processed by the network and produces a predicted output. If the predicted output is not correct, we calculate the error between it and the actual output (the correct label for the digit in the image). We then propagate the error backward through the network, starting from the output layer and moving backward through the hidden layer to the input layer. At each layer, we calculate the error contribution of each neuron and adjust the weights of the connections between them based on that contribution. We repeat this process for many iterations, gradually refining the weights of the connections until the network can accurately classify handwritten digits with a high degree of accuracy.
