1. What is a loss function?
Answer: A loss function is a mathematical function used to evaluate the difference between the predicted values and the actual values in a machine learning model.

2. How is the performance of a machine learning model evaluated using loss functions?
Answer: The performance of a machine learning model is evaluated by minimizing the value of the loss function.

3. What is the difference between a regression loss function and a classification loss function?
Answer: A regression loss function is used for predicting continuous numeric values, whereas a classification loss function is used for predicting categorical values.

4. Can you describe the differences between Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss functions?
Answer: The MAE loss function measures the average difference between the predicted and actual values, while MSE loss function measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. 

5. Can you name a popular classification loss function and its purpose?
Answer: Cross-entropy loss function is a popular classification loss function. It is used to evaluate the difference between the predicted distribution and the true distribution of the categorical data.
