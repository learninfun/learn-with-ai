1. What is the purpose of an activation function in a neural network?
Answer: The purpose of an activation function is to introduce nonlinearity into the output of a neural network, allowing it to model complex patterns.

2. What are some common activation functions used in neural networks?
Answer: Some common activation functions include the sigmoid function, the hyperbolic tangent function, the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) function, and the softmax function.

3. What is the difference between a linear and nonlinear activation function?
Answer: A linear activation function produces a linear output, whereas a nonlinear activation function produces a curved output with more complex patterns.

4. What is the vanishing gradient problem?
Answer: The vanishing gradient problem occurs when the derivative of the activation function becomes extremely small, preventing the weights from updating effectively during training.

5. How does the choice of activation function affect the performance of a neural network?
Answer: The choice of activation function can greatly impact the performance of a neural network, as different functions may be better suited for different types of tasks or data. For example, ReLU is often used for image recognition tasks, while tanh is used for language processing tasks.
