1. What is the main purpose of backpropagation in neural networks? 
Answer: Backpropagation is used to adjust the weight values of a neural network to improve its accuracy in predicting outputs.

2. How does backpropagation work? 
Answer: Backpropagation works by using a calculated error signal to adjust the weight values of the network's connections in a way that reduces the overall error between predicted and actual outputs.

3. What are the limitations of backpropagation? 
Answer: Backpropagation may sometimes get stuck in local optima instead of finding the global minimum, and can be computationally expensive for large networks.

4. What is the role of the learning rate parameter in backpropagation? 
Answer: The learning rate determines the size of weight adjustments made during backpropagation, and can greatly affect the speed and accuracy of the training process.

5. How does regularization help to prevent overfitting during backpropagation? 
Answer: Regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization add a penalty term to the loss function used during backpropagation, encouraging the network to learn simpler and more generalizable representations of the input data rather than memorizing specific examples.
