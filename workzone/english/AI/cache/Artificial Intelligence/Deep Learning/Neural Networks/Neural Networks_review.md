1. What is a neural network?

Answer: A neural network is a type of machine learning model that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It is a complex network of computational nodes called neurons that work together to process information and make predictions.

2. What is backpropagation?

Answer: Backpropagation is an algorithm used to train neural networks. It works by computing the error between the predicted output and the actual output, and then adjusting the weights of the neurons in the network to minimize this error. Backpropagation is an iterative process that continues until the error is minimized.

3. What is overfitting in neural networks?

Answer: Overfitting is a common problem in neural networks where the model becomes too complex and fits the training data too closely. This can result in poor performance on new and unseen data. Overfitting can be prevented by regularizing the model, using dropout, or using early stopping.

4. What is convolutional neural network (CNN)?

Answer: A CNN is a type of neural network designed for image and video processing. It consists of multiple layers of computational nodes that perform convolutions, pooling, and other operations on the input data. CNNs are particularly good at detecting features in images and recognizing objects.

5. What is transfer learning in neural networks?

Answer: Transfer learning is the process of using a pre-trained neural network to solve a new task. Instead of training a new model from scratch, transfer learning involves fine-tuning an existing model on a new dataset. This can save time and resources and result in better performance on the new task.
