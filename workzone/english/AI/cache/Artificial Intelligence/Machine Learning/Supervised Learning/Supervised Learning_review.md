1. What is Supervised Learning?
Answer: Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on labelled datasets. These labelled datasets are whereby the algorithms learn through inputs and outputs.

2. What is the objective of Supervised Learning?
Answer: The objective of Supervised Learning is to develop a model that can classify a given input into known pre-defined categories while minimizing the error in prediction.

3. What is the difference between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning?
Answer: Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning are two different approaches to machine learning. In Supervised Learning, datasets have an already-existing output variable, whereas, in Unsupervised Learning, the dataset does not have any labelled output variable.

4. What are some common algorithms used in Supervised Learning?
Answer: Some common algorithms used in Supervised Learning are Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.

5. What are some disadvantages of Supervised Learning?
Answer: One of the major disadvantages of Supervised Learning is that it requires a significant amount of labelled data. Also, Supervised Learning algorithms tend to overfit the data, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data. Another disadvantage is that the resulting model can be biased towards certain types of input data, which may result in inaccurate predictions.
