Supervised learning is a method of machine learning in which the algorithm learns to make predictions from a set of labeled data. The labeled data consists of input features (also known as independent variables) and their corresponding output values (also known as dependent variables or labels). The algorithm is designed to learn the relationship between the input features and output values so that it can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

An example of supervised learning is predicting the house prices based on various features, such as the number of rooms, the size of the house, the location, and the age of the house. In this case, the input features are the number of rooms, the size of the house, the location, and the age of the house, and the output value is the predicted house price. The algorithm is trained on a dataset of labeled data that includes the features and their corresponding house prices. The model then learns to make predictions by identifying the patterns and relationships between the input features and output values. Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the house prices of new, unseen data based on its learned patterns and relationships.
