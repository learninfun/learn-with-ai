Classification refers to the process of categorizing objects, people or ideas into groups based on specific characteristics or properties they possess. The purpose of classification is to create order, identify patterns and similarities, and better understand the world around us.

For example, animals can be classified into different groups based on their similarity in terms of different characteristics, such as body structure, habitat, diet, and mode of reproduction. These groups are:

1. Mammals: Animals that have a body covered with fur or hair, give birth to live young, and nurse their young with milk.

2. Birds: Animals that have feathers, lay eggs, and have lightweight bones.

3. Fish: Animals that live in water, breathe through gills, and have fins and scales.

4. Reptiles: Animals that have scaly skin, lay eggs on land, and are cold-blooded.

5. Amphibians: Animals that have moist skin, lay eggs in water, and undergo metamorphosis from a larval stage to an adult stage.

6. Invertebrates: Animals that do not have a backbone, such as insects, spiders, and worms.

By classifying animals, we can better understand their unique characteristics, their place in the ecosystem, and how they are related to other living beings.
