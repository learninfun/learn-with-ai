1. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm used for classification tasks.

2. It is based on Bayes' theorem and assumes independence between features.

3. It is particularly effective when working with a large number of features.

4. Naive Bayes can handle both categorical and continuous data.

5. It works by calculating the probability of a data point belonging to a particular class based on the probability of its features within that class.

6. It is easy to implement and requires minimal data preparation.

7. Naive Bayes is known for its speed and scalability.

8. However, its accuracy can be affected by the assumption of independence and the presence of correlated features.
