Decision trees refer to a tree-like model that shows the potential outcomes of a decision or choice. It's a graphical representation that presents a sequence of decisions and their possible consequences.

The structure of a decision tree consists of internal nodes that represent the decision-making points, branches that connect the nodes to the outcomes, and leaf nodes that display the final result of the decision-making process. Each decision node defines a question, and each branch represents an answer to that question.

A simple example of a decision tree would be choosing what to eat for breakfast. The decision tree would start with the question, "Do you want something sweet or savory?" If the answer is "sweet," the next decision point would be "Do you want cereal or pancakes?" If the answer is "cereal," the final outcome could be "pick a flavor of cereal to eat." However, if the answer is "pancakes," the next question would be "Do you want chocolate chip pancakes or blueberry pancakes?" and the final outcome would be "pick the type of pancake to eat." 

Decision trees are useful in various fields, including business, analytics, and medicine, to analyze data, make informed decisions, and identify potential outcomes.
