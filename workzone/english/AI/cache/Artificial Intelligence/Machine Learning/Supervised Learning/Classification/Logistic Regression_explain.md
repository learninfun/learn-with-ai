Logistic Regression is a statistical method that is used to analyze and model the relationships between a categorical dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is primarily used to predict the probability of an event occurring, such as the likelihood of a customer making a purchase, based on certain predictors.

For example, a marketing team might use logistic regression to predict whether a customer is likely to buy a particular product based on age, gender, and income. The team could collect and analyze data from past sales, and then use logistic regression to create a model that calculates the probability of the customer making a purchase based on the variables. This could help the team to create targeted marketing campaigns and promotional offers that are more likely to appeal to the customer and lead to a sale.
