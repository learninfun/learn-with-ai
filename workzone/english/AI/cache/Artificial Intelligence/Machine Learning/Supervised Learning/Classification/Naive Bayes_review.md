1. What is Naive Bayes and how does it work?
Answer: Naive Bayes is a machine learning algorithm that uses probability theory to classify data based on pre-defined categories. It does this by calculating the likelihood of each category given the input data and selecting the category with the highest likelihood.

2. What are the assumptions made by Naive Bayes?
Answer: Naive Bayes assumes that all features in the input data are independent of each other and that the probability distribution of each feature is known. This is known as the "naive" assumption.

3. How do you handle missing data in Naive Bayes?
Answer: One way to handle missing data in Naive Bayes is to use a simple imputation technique such as mean imputation, where the missing value is replaced by the mean of the available values for that feature.

4. How do you evaluate the performance of a Naive Bayes classifier?
Answer: The performance of a Naive Bayes classifier can be evaluated using measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These measures can be calculated by comparing the predicted classifications to the actual classifications of the test data.

5. What are some real-world applications of Naive Bayes?
Answer: Naive Bayes is commonly used in spam filtering, sentiment analysis, text classification, and disease diagnosis. It can also be used in image recognition and recommendation systems.
