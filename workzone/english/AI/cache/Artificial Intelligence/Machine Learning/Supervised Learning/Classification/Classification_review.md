1. Question: What is the difference between logistic regression and decision trees for classification tasks?
Answer: Logistic regression is a linear model that makes predictions based on a weighted sum of the input features, while decision trees use a tree-like model to split the data based on feature values. Logistic regression is better suited for linearly separable data, while decision trees are more flexible and can handle non-linear decision boundaries.

2. Question: How can you handle imbalanced datasets in classification tasks?
Answer: One way to handle imbalanced datasets is to use resampling techniques such as oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or generating synthetic samples using techniques such as SMOTE. Another approach is to use cost-sensitive learning, where a higher misclassification cost is assigned to the minority class.

3. Question: What is cross-validation and how is it used in classification tasks?
Answer: Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. The data is divided into k subsets, and the model is trained on k-1 subsets and evaluated on the remaining subset. This process is repeated k times, with each subset serving as the evaluation set once. The average performance across all k iterations is used as the final estimate of the model's performance.

4. Question: What is regularization in machine learning classification and why is it used?
Answer: Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. It adds a penalty term to the loss function that encourages the model to have smaller weights. Regularization is used to improve the generalization performance of the model by reducing its variance, and it can be applied to various machine learning models, including logistic regression and decision trees.

5. Question: What is the difference between precision and recall in classification tasks?
Answer: Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive examples to the total number of predicted positive examples. It measures the accuracy of positive predictions. Recall, on the other hand, is the ratio of correctly predicted positive examples to the total number of actual positive examples. It measures the completeness of positive predictions. A good model should have high precision and high recall, but there is often a trade-off between the two.
