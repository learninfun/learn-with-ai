Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The main idea of SVMs is to find a hyperplane that can best separate two classes or target variables in a dataset. SVMs try to maximize the margin, which is the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from both classes. SVMs are effective in handling high-dimensional and complex datasets.

For example, let's say we have a dataset of patients who have or have not been diagnosed with a particular disease. The data includes age, gender, blood pressure, and other health-related features. Using SVMs, we can classify the patients into two categories - those who have the disease and those who do not. The hyperplane found by SVMs will be the one that separates the two classes with the largest possible margin. This helps us in accurately identifying patients at risk of the disease and enabling healthcare professionals to provide necessary treatment. SVMs can also be used for other types of classification problems, such as spam filtering or image recognition.
