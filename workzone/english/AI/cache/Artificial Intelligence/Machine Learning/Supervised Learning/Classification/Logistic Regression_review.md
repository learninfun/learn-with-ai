1. What is logistic regression used for?
Answer: Logistic regression is a statistical method used for predicting a dichotomous outcome variable (for example, "yes" or "no", "0" or "1").

2. What is the difference between linear regression and logistic regression?
Answer: Linear regression is used to predict continuous outcomes, while logistic regression is used to predict categorical outcomes.

3. What is the significance level in logistic regression?
Answer: The significance level in logistic regression refers to the probability level at which the observed results are unlikely to have occurred by chance.

4. What is the maximum likelihood estimation method used for in logistic regression?
Answer: The maximum likelihood estimation method is used to obtain the values of the model parameters that maximize the likelihood function and provide the best fit for the data.

5. What is an odds ratio in logistic regression?
Answer: An odds ratio is a measure of how much more likely one group is to experience a particular outcome compared to another group. In logistic regression, it is used to estimate the effect of a predictor variable on the probability of the outcome variable.
