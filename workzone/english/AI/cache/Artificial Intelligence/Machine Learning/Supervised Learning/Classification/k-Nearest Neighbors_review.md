1. What is k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)? 
Answer: k-NN is a non-parametric algorithm used for classification and regression. It determines the class (or value) of a new sample by comparing it to k nearest samples in the training set.

2. How is the value of k chosen in k-NN? 
Answer: The value of k is chosen based on the size of the training set and the complexity of the problem. Typically, a small value of k is chosen for simple problems and a larger value of k is chosen for more complex problems.

3. What is the curse of dimensionality in k-NN? 
Answer: The curse of dimensionality refers to the problem of increasing computational complexity as the number of features (dimensions) in the data increases. This can make it difficult for k-NN to find the nearest neighbors due to the large number of possible combinations.

4. What is the difference between weightage voting and uniform voting in k-NN? 
Answer: In weightage voting, the nearest neighbors are weighted based on their distances, and the predicted class (or value) is determined by the sum of the weighted votes. In uniform voting, all nearest neighbors are given equal weights, and the predicted class is determined by the majority vote.

5. What are some applications of k-NN? 
Answer: k-NN is used in a variety of applications, such as image recognition, recommendation systems, anomaly detection, and fraud detection. It is especially useful when the data is high-dimensional and the decision boundaries are complex.
