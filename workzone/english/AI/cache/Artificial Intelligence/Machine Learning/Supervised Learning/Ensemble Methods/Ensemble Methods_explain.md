Ensemble methods are a type of machine learning method that combine multiple models to improve accuracy and performance. These models can be combined in different ways, such as by averaging their predictions or using a voting system. The idea behind ensemble methods is that by combining multiple models, the strengths of each individual model can be leveraged to create a more robust and accurate prediction.

An example of ensemble methods is Random Forest. A random forest is a type of ensemble machine learning algorithm that uses multiple decision trees to improve the predictive performance of the model. Each decision tree is built using a subset of the training data and a random subset of the features. The predictions of the individual decision trees are then combined by averaging the results to create the final prediction. Random forest is a popular algorithm for classification and regression tasks in various fields such as finance, medicine, and marketing.
