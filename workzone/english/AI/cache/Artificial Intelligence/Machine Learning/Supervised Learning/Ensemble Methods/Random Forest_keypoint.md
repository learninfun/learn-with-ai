1. Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis.

2. It is an ensemble learning method, which combines multiple decision trees to provide a robust and accurate prediction.

3. Each tree in the Random Forest is trained on a random subset of the input data and a random subset of the input features.

4. The output of the Random Forest algorithm is the average or mode of the predictions made by each individual tree.

5. Random Forest is capable of handling missing values, outlier detection, and high-dimensional data.

6. It can also provide insights into feature importance, making it useful for feature selection.

7. Random Forest is less prone to overfitting than a single decision tree, making it a valuable tool for prediction in many real-world problems.
