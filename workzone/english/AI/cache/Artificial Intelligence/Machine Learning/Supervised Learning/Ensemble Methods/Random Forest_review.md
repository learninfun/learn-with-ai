1. What is Random Forest and how does it work? 
Answer: Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm that uses an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions. It creates multiple decision trees on random subsets of the data and summarizes the results to make a final prediction.

2. How do you determine the optimal number of trees in a Random Forest model? 
Answer: One approach is to try different numbers of trees and measure the performance on a validation set. The optimal number of trees is typically reached when the error rate stabilizes.

3. Can Random Forest handle missing data? 
Answer: Yes, Random Forest can handle missing data with different imputation techniques, such as mean imputation, median imputation, and mode imputation.

4. What is the importance measure in Random Forest and how is it calculated? 
Answer: The importance measure in Random Forest indicates the contribution of each feature to the overall prediction accuracy. It is calculated by measuring the decrease in impurity when a feature is used to split the data and averaged across all trees.

5. Can Random Forest be used for regression problems? 
Answer: Yes, Random Forest can be used for both classification and regression problems. For regression problems, it predicts the average response value of the trees in the forest.
