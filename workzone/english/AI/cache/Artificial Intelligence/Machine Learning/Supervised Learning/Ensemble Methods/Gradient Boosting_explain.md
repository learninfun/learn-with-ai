Gradient Boosting is a type of ensemble machine learning algorithm used for regression and classification problems. The algorithm involves combining many weak learners to create a strong learner that can make accurate predictions. Each weak learner is trained on the difference between the predicted output and the actual output of the previous learner. This way, the algorithm learns from its own mistakes and becomes more accurate with each iteration.

An example of Gradient Boosting can be predicting the sale price of a car based on its features such as the model, year, mileage, and condition. The algorithm would be trained on a dataset of car sales with their corresponding features and sale prices. It would use multiple weak learners to create a strong learner that can accurately predict the sale price of a new car. In this case, each weak learner would focus on improving the accuracy of a specific feature and the final prediction would be based on the combined results of all the weak learners.
