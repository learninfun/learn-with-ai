Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression tasks. It works by constructing multiple decision trees, where each tree is built by taking a random subset of the training data and a random subset of the available features. In the case of classification, the final output is determined by the mode of the class predictions of all the individual trees, while for regression it is determined by the average of the predicted values.

For example, suppose we want to predict whether a person is likely to buy a car or not. We have a dataset that contains information about various customers, including their age, income, job, gender, and car ownership status. We can use Random Forest to build a model that uses this dataset to predict whether a new customer is likely to buy a car or not. The algorithm will create multiple decision trees, where each tree considers a random subset of the available features and a subset of the training data. The final prediction is made by combining the outputs of all the trees in the forest, where the final predicted class is the mode of all the predicted classes of the individual trees.
