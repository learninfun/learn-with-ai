AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is a type of ensemble learning technique in which multiple weak models are combined to form a stronger model. The weak models are typically decision trees or other simple models that perform only slightly better than random guessing. 

The algorithm works by iteratively training weak models on different subsets of the training data. In each iteration, the algorithm assigns a weight to each data point based on how difficult it was to classify correctly in the previous iteration. The weight distribution goes through an update in each iteration based on the performance of the current model.

For example, suppose we want to predict whether a customer will churn from a telecom provider. We have a dataset consisting of customer demographics, call history, billing information, and other relevant features. We can use AdaBoost to train a series of decision trees on different subsets of the data. In each iteration, the algorithm gives more weight to the misclassified data points and less weight to the correctly classified ones. This approach puts more emphasis on the difficult-to-classify data points and helps the algorithm focus on the areas where it struggles. The final model is a combination of all these weak models, and it is usually more robust and accurate than any single model.
