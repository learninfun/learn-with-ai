Linear regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes that the relationship between the variables can be modeled through a straight line.

For example, if we want to study the relationship between rainfall and crop yield, we can use linear regression. The dependent variable here is crop yield, while the independent variable is rainfall. We can plot the data points for both variables on a scatter plot, and then fit a line that best represents the data.

Based on the slope and intercept of this line, we can then predict the yield of crops for different levels of rainfall. If the slope of the line is positive, we know that increasing rainfall leads to higher crop yields. Conversely, if the slope is negative, we know that increasing rainfall leads to lower yields.

The goal of linear regression is to find the line that best fits the data and allows us to make accurate predictions about the relationship between the variables. We can use different techniques such as least squares, maximum likelihood, or gradient descent to estimate the slope and intercept of the line.
