Ridge Regression is a regression technique that is used to deal with the problem of multicollinearity in linear regression models. In simple terms, it is a technique used when there is too much correlation among the predictor variables. Ridge Regression shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero, which helps to address the problem of overfitting and to improve the predictive accuracy of the model.

The Ridge Regression formula is:

βridge = argmin(∑i(yi−(β0+β1xi1+β2xi2+...+βpxip))^2 + λ∑jβj^2)

Where:

- β0, β1, β2, ... βp are the regression coefficients,
- xi1, xi2, ... xip are the predictor variables, 
- yi is the dependent variable,
- λ is the regularization parameter, which serves as a tuning parameter that controls the strength of the regularization.

Example:
Suppose we want to predict the selling price of a house based on various predictor variables such as the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, the presence of a pool, etc. If some of these predictor variables are highly correlated with each other, then Ridge Regression can be used to address this problem. We can use Ridge Regression to estimate the regression coefficients and to control the degree of regularization by carefully choosing the value of the regularization parameter λ. By adding the regularization term, we can reduce the coefficients of those predictors that are less important, and thus control the overfitting of the model.
