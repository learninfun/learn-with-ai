Regression is a statistical method that predicts the relationship between a dependent variable (outcome) and one or more independent variables (predictors). It is used to estimate the relationship between two or more variables using a mathematical formula, which can then be used to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables. 

For example, suppose you want to predict the price of a house based on its size, location, and number of bedrooms. You would collect data on these variables from a sample of houses, and then use regression analysis to estimate the relationship between these variables and the price of the house. The resulting equation would allow you to predict the price of any new house based on its size, location, and number of bedrooms.
