1. What is the purpose of linear regression analysis?
Answer: Linear regression analysis is used to identify and analyze the linear relationship between two continuous variables. It is used to predict future values of a dependent variable based on the values of one or more independent variables.

2. What is the difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression?
Answer: Simple linear regression involves predicting a dependent variable using only one independent variable, while multiple linear regression involves predicting a dependent variable using multiple independent variables.

3. How is the line of best fit determined in linear regression?
Answer: The line of best fit is determined by minimizing the sum of squared errors (the difference between the actual and predicted values of the dependent variable). This is done using a technique called least squares regression.

4. What is the coefficient of determination in linear regression?
Answer: The coefficient of determination (R-squared) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s) in the model. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit.

5. What is the difference between a residual plot and a fitted value plot in linear regression?
Answer: A residual plot shows the difference between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable. A fitted value plot shows how well the actual data points fit the predicted values of the dependent variable.
