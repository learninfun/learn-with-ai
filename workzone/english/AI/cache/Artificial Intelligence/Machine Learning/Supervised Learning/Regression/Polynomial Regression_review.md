1. What is the order of a polynomial used in polynomial regression?
Answer: The order of a polynomial used in polynomial regression is any positive integer, typically denoted by "d".

2.How is the polynomial regression equation represented mathematically?
Answer: The polynomial regression equation is represented mathematically as y = β0 + β1x + β2x^2 + ... + βdx^d, where y is the dependent variable, β's are the regression coefficients, and x is the independent variable.

3. How do you evaluate the goodness-of-fit for a polynomial regression model?
Answer: You can evaluate the goodness-of-fit for a polynomial regression model using metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R^2), root mean squared error (RMSE), or mean absolute error (MAE).

4. Can polynomial regression be used for non-linear relationships?
Answer: Yes, polynomial regression can be used for non-linear relationships between the dependent and independent variables. By adding higher order terms, the model can capture more complex patterns in the relationship.

5. What is the difference between simple linear regression and polynomial regression?
Answer: Simple linear regression has only one independent variable and fits a straight line to the data, while polynomial regression can accommodate multiple independent variables and fits a curved line to the data by adding higher-order terms.
