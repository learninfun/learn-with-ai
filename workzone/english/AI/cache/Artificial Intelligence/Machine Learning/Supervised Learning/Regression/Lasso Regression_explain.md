Lasso Regression, also known as Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a type of linear regression that aims to find the best subset of predictor variables for predicting the dependent variable. It works by applying a penalty on the coefficients of the regression equation, resulting in some coefficients being reduced to zero. This can effectively remove irrelevant or redundant predictors from the model and improve its predictive performance.

An example of Lasso Regression would be predicting the selling price of a house based on various independent variables such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, age of the house, and so on. By using Lasso Regression, we can determine which independent variables are most important in predicting the selling price, potentially removing any redundant or insignificant factors. This can help us create a more accurate model and avoid overfitting.
