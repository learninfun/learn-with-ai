1. Linear Regression is a statistical approach used to establish a relationship between two variables, where one is an independent variable and the other is a dependent variable.
2. The aim of Linear Regression is to find a line that best represents the relationship between the two variables, which can be used to predict future values of the dependent variable based on the independent variable.
3. The line that best fits the data is called the regression line, and it is determined based on the principle of minimizing the sum of squared errors between the observed values and the predicted values.
4. The slope of the regression line represents the change in the dependent variable for a unit change in the independent variable.
5. The intercept of the regression line represents the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero.
6. Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship between the two variables, which may not always be the case in real-world scenarios.
7. Linear Regression can be performed using various techniques like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Gradient Descent, and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).
8. Linear Regression can be extended to multiple variables, where the relationship between the dependent variable and multiple independent variables is analyzed.
