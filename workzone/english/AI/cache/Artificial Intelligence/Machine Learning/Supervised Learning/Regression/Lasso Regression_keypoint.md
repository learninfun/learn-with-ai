1. Lasso regression is a type of linear regression technique used for feature selection and regularization.

2. It works by penalizing the magnitude of individual coefficients in the linear regression equation.

3. The penalty term used in the Lasso regression is the L1-norm, which adds the absolute values of the coefficients.

4. By imposing this penalty, Lasso regression encourages sparse solutions, meaning it can effectively zero out the coefficients of irrelevant or redundant predictors in the model.

5. Lasso regression can handle data with a large number of predictors or variables, but it is sensitive to correlated predictors and can cause unstable models or zero out important predictors.

6. Hyperparameters, such as the regularization strength and the selection of predictors, can profoundly affect the performance and stability of Lasso regression models.

7. Lasso regression is widely used in machine learning applications, such as feature selection, image and signal processing, genomics, and finance.
