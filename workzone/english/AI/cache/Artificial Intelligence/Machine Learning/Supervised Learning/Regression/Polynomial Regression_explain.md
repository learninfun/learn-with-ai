Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis in which a polynomial function is used to model the relationship between the independent variable (X) and dependent variable (Y). It is a nonlinear regression model that can capture more complex patterns in data compared to linear regression.

For example, consider the following data points:

x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [0, 3, 6, 8, 13, 20]

Using linear regression, the line of best fit would be:

y = 2.87 + 2.23x

However, this may not accurately capture the non-linear relationship between x and y. Instead, we can use polynomial regression to fit a more complex curve. Setting the degree of the polynomial to 2, the equation would be:

y = 0.50 + 3.61x + 0.69x^2

This model better fits the data points and can be used to make more accurate predictions for values of x outside the given range.
