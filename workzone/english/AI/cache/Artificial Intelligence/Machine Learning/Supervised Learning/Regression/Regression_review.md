1. What is the difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression?
- Simple linear regression involves only one independent variable and one dependent variable, while multiple linear regression involves two or more independent variables and one dependent variable.

2. What is the purpose of residual analysis in regression?
- The purpose of residual analysis in regression is to check the model assumptions, such as normality, homoscedasticity, and linearity. Residual plots can help to identify any patterns, outliers, or non-linear relationships that may indicate problems with the model.

3. How do you interpret the coefficient of determination (R-squared) in regression?
- The coefficient of determination (R-squared) represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable. A value of R-squared close to 1 indicates a strong relationship between the variables, while a value closer to 0 indicates a weaker relationship.

4. What is multicollinearity in regression?
- Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated with each other, which can lead to unstable and inconsistent estimates of the coefficients. This can be detected by examining the correlation matrix of the independent variables.

5. What is the difference between correlation and regression?
- Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, while regression models the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable by estimating the coefficients of a linear equation. Correlation does not imply causation, while regression can help to identify causal relationships.
