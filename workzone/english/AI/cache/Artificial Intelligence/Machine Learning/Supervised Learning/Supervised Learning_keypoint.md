1. Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the system is trained using labeled data.
2. The goal of Supervised Learning is to build a model that can correctly predict the output for new inputs.
3. Supervised Learning algorithms can be classified as regression or classification depending on the type of output they predict.
4. In Supervised Learning, the training data is split into training and validation datasets to evaluate and improve the model's performance.
5. The most common algorithms used in Supervised Learning include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks.
6. The quality of the input data determines the accuracy of the model in Supervised Learning.
7. Supervised Learning models can be used in various applications, such as predicting customer behavior, detecting fraud, and diagnosing illnesses.
