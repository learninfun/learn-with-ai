As an AI language model, I can provide five questions about Principal Component Analysis:

1. What is Principal Component Analysis and what is its main objective?
2. What are the assumptions made while performing the Principal Component Analysis?
3. How is the number of principal components chosen in Principal Component Analysis?
4. Can PCA be used to reduce the number of features in a dataset? If so, how is that achieved?
5. Can PCA be used for classification or regression problems? How can it be incorporated into a machine learning pipeline?
