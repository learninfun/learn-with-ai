1. Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of input features in a dataset.

2. It improves the performance of machine learning models by simplifying the input space.

3. It helps in visualization of data by reducing the data to two or three dimensions.

4. It also helps in dealing with the curse of dimensionality, which occurs when the number of input features is too high compared to the number of observations.

5. There are two types of dimensionality reduction techniques: feature selection and feature extraction.

6. Feature selection techniques select the most important features from the input dataset.

7. Feature extraction techniques create new features from the existing ones that retain most of the variance in the original dataset.

8. Some popular dimensionality reduction techniques are PCA, t-SNE, and LLE.
