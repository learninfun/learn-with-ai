Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to simplify complex data sets by reducing the number of variables while retaining essential information. It provides insights into the underlying data structure and identifies correlations between different variables. PCA is widely used in various fields, including finance, marketing, engineering, and medicine.

Example: Consider a data set with 10 variables that measure different aspects of a product's performance. The variables include features such as speed, accuracy, durability, efficiency, and cost. PCA can be applied to this data set to identify the principal components that best explain the variability in the data. The first principal component may be a linear combination of speed, accuracy, and efficiency, which explains most of the variation in the data. The second principal component may be a combination of durability and cost, while the third component could be a mix of the remaining variables. PCA helps to simplify the data set by identifying the most significant variables and reducing the dimensionality of the data, making it easier to analyze and interpret.
