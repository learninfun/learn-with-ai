t-SNE stands for t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, it is a technique used for reducing high-dimensional data to low-dimensional space while preserving the local and global structure of the data. The technique is based on a probability distribution that models similarities between data points in high-dimensional space and uses an optimization process to find a low-dimensional embedding where the similarities are preserved.

An example application of t-SNE is in visualizing high-dimensional data such as images or text. For instance, let's assume you have a dataset of 10,000 images, where each image has 784 pixels (28x28) and you want to reduce each image to a 2D space so that you can visualize them. You can use t-SNE technique to convert each image into 2D space while preserving the structure of the images. This allows you to easily visualize the images and identify patterns or clusters in the data.
