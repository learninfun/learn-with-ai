1. What is t-SNE and how does it differ from other dimensionality reduction techniques? 
Answer: t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) is a machine learning algorithm used for data visualization and reducing high dimensional data into lower dimensional space. It differs from other techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) as it can preserve the local structure of the data in the lower dimensional space as well.

2. How does t-SNE work? 
Answer: t-SNE works by mapping the high-dimensional space into a lower dimensional space while preserving the similarity relationships between the points in the original high-dimensional space. It first computes pairwise similarities between data points in the original space and then tries to represent these similarities in a low-dimensional space with a different distribution using a probability density function.

3. What are some common uses of t-SNE in real-world applications? 
Answer: t-SNE is often used for visualizing high-dimensional data, data clustering, and anomaly detection. It has been used in fields such as bioinformatics, natural language processing, image analysis, and finance.

4. What are the limitations of t-SNE? 
Answer: One limitation of t-SNE is that it can only visualize a maximum of three dimensions, which means that the structure and relationships may not be fully represented. Additionally, t-SNE is a computationally expensive algorithm and can be slow for large datasets.

5. How can one optimize the parameters of t-SNE for their specific dataset? 
Answer: The two primary parameters that can be optimized for t-SNE are the perplexity and learning rate. The perplexity controls how to balance attention to local and global details, while the learning rate controls the amount of optimization that takes place during each iteration. Optimizing these parameters will require testing different values and comparing the resulting visualizations to select the best configuration for a given dataset.
