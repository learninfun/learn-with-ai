1. t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a machine learning algorithm for visualizing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space, typically 2D or 3D.

2. t-SNE uses a probabilistic approach to represent similarity relationships between points in the high-dimensional space as probabilities, and then maps these probabilities to a low-dimensional space.

3. The algorithm is non-linear, meaning that it can capture more complex relationships between data points than linear techniques like PCA.

4. t-SNE is commonly used in data visualization and exploratory data analysis, especially in fields like bioinformatics, natural language processing, and computer vision.

5. t-SNE has some limitations, including a lack of global structure preservation and its sensitivity to algorithm parameters, which can impact the resulting visualization.
