1. What is the main goal of Principal Component Analysis (PCA)? 
Answer: The main goal of PCA is to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while retaining as much of the original variability as possible.

2. How does PCA determine the principal components of a dataset? 
Answer: PCA uses linear algebra to determine the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the dataset's covariance matrix. The eigenvectors represent the directions of maximum variability in the dataset, and the eigenvalues represent the magnitude of that variability.

3. How can you use PCA to visualize high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D? 
Answer: PCA can be used to transform a high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional space, such as 2D or 3D. The first two or three principal components can be selected, and the data points can be plotted in this reduced space.

4. What is the importance of the explained variance ratio in PCA? 
Answer: The explained variance ratio represents the proportion of total variance in the dataset that is explained by each principal component. It is important because it allows us to determine how much information is retained by each component, and how many components are needed to adequately capture the original variability of the data.

5. How does PCA deal with missing data? 
Answer: PCA can handle missing data through imputation, which involves estimating or filling in missing values based on the available data points. However, the effectiveness of this approach may depend on the amount and nature of the missing data.
