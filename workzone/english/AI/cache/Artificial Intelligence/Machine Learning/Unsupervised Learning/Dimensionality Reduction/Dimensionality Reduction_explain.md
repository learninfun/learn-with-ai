Dimensionality reduction refers to the process of reducing the number of features or variables used in statistical models. It is a method used to simplify data for analysis, minimize overfitting, and improve the efficiency of the data models. Dimensionality reduction is commonly used in data analysis, machine learning, and field statistics.

For example, suppose we have a dataset with thousands of features or variables, and we want to apply machine learning to this data to make predictions. In this case, using all the features might result in overfitting, which leads to a less efficient and less interpretable model. Dimensionality reduction can help to identify the important features that contribute to the prediction and ignore the non-essential ones. As a result, we can simplify the dataset and develop a more efficient and accurate model. 

One popular approach for dimensionality reduction is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which transforms the original data into a lower dimensional representation while retaining most of the variability in the data. PCA can be used for data visualization, image compression, and feature extraction in machine learning models.
