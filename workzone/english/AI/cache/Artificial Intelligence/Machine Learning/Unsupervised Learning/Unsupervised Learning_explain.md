Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm in which the system learns from input data without any labeled output. In other words, it is used to find patterns in data without the need for explicit feedback.

An example of unsupervised learning is clustering. In clustering, the system groups data points with similar characteristics together, without any prior knowledge of what those characteristics might be. For instance, clustering could be used to group customers based on their buying habits or to group images based on similarity. This allows businesses to better understand their customers and tailor their marketing efforts accordingly. Clustering is just one example of unsupervised learning, and there are many other techniques in this category that can be applied to various types of data.
