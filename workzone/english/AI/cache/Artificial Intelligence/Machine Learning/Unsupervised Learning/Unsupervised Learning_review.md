1. What is unsupervised learning and how does it differ from supervised learning?

Answer: Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique where data is not labeled or classified, and the aim is to find patterns and relationships in the data without being given specific output values like in supervised learning.

2. What are some common unsupervised learning algorithms used to cluster data?

Answer: Some common unsupervised learning algorithms used to cluster data include k-means, hierarchical clustering, and density-based clustering.

3. How does PCA (Principal Component Analysis) work in unsupervised learning?

Answer: PCA is a technique used in unsupervised learning to reduce the dimensions of a dataset. It does this by identifying the principal components of the data, which are the orthogonal vectors that explain the maximum variance in the data.

4. What is the difference between density-based clustering and hierarchical clustering?

Answer: Density-based clustering is a technique that groups together data based on their neighbor points in a given radius, while hierarchical clustering is a technique that groups together data based on their similarity in a tree-like structure.

5. What are some potential applications of unsupervised learning?

Answer: Some potential applications of unsupervised learning include image recognition, anomaly detection, recommendation systems, and natural language processing.
