Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that involves training algorithms on unlabeled data.

The key points of unsupervised learning are:

1. Aims to identify patterns, structures and relationships in data without any prior knowledge or guidance.
2. The algorithms do not have labeled output or target variable but instead they learn from the inherent structure of the data itself.
3. Clustering is the most common application of unsupervised learning which involves grouping similar data points together.
4. Another popular technique is dimensionality reduction, where high-dimensional data is transformed into a lower-dimensional space while retaining important features of the data.
5. There are several types of clustering algorithms, including hierarchical, k-means, and density-based clustering.
6. Unsupervised learning can be used for exploratory data analysis and anomaly detection.
7. It is particularly useful in cases where labeled data is scarce or expensive to acquire.
8. Unsupervised learning is also used in natural language processing (NLP) to identify topics and create word embeddings.
