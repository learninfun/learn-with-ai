1. What is Hierarchical Clustering? 
Answer: Hierarchical Clustering is a type of clustering algorithm that groups together data points with close similarities and builds a hierarchy of clusters.

2. What is the difference between Agglomerative and Divisive Hierarchical Clustering? 
Answer: Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering is the bottom-up approach, where each observation starts in its cluster, and the algorithm merges the closest pairs of clusters until there is only one cluster. Divisive Hierarchical Clustering is the top-down approach, where all observations start in one cluster, and the algorithm splits the cluster recursively into smaller clusters until each observation is in its cluster.

3. What are the advantages of Hierarchical Clustering? 
Answer: Hierarchical Clustering is simple to understand and interpret, does not require a prior assumption of the number of clusters, and provides a visual representation of the clusters' hierarchy.

4. How do you determine the optimal number of clusters in Hierarchical Clustering? 
Answer: There are several methods to determine the optimal number of clusters, including Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, Gap Statistic, and Dendrogram Analysis.

5. What are the applications of Hierarchical Clustering? 
Answer: Hierarchical Clustering is used in various fields, such as biology, social sciences, marketing, and healthcare, to group similar objects or individuals, identify patterns, and make predictions.
