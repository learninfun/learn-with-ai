k-Means is a clustering algorithm that is used in unsupervised machine learning to group similar data points into clusters. The k-means algorithm aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.

The steps of the algorithm are as follows:

1. Choose the number of clusters (k) that you want to group your data into.
2. Randomly select k data points from your dataset to act as the initial centroids.
3. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on the Euclidean distance.
4. Recalculate the centroid for each cluster by taking the mean of all data points in that cluster.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the centroids no longer change or until a maximum number of iterations is reached.

Example:
Suppose you have a dataset of customer purchase history for an e-commerce website. Each row of the dataset represents a customer and their purchases. You want to group customers into different segments based on their purchase behavior. You decide to use k-Means to do this.

1. Choose the number of clusters (k) you want to group your customers into. Let k=3.
2. Randomly select 3 customers from your dataset to act as the initial centroids.
3. Assign each customer to the nearest centroid based on the Euclidean distance.
4. Recalculate the centroid for each cluster by taking the mean of all the customers in that cluster.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the centroids no longer change or until a maximum number of iterations is reached.

After several iterations, you end up with three different clusters of customers based on their purchase behavior. These clusters may represent different segments of customers such as high spenders, occasional shoppers, and bargain hunters. You can then use these clusters to tailor marketing campaigns or make other business decisions.
