1. k-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that is used for clustering data.

2. It is used to partition a dataset into k clusters, where k is a user-defined number.

3. The algorithm works by assigning each data point to the closest centroid, which is the center of each cluster.

4. The centroids are recomputed by taking the mean of all the data points assigned to them.

5. The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to centroids and recomputes them until the centroid values stabilize.

6. The k-Means algorithm uses the within-cluster-sum-of-squares (WCSS) metric to evaluate the quality of clusters.

7. WCSS is calculated by measuring the square distance between the data points and their assigned centroids.

8. The optimal value of k is determined by finding the elbow point on a graph of WCSS against the number of clusters.

9. k-Means is an efficient algorithm that can handle large datasets and is commonly used for image segmentation, market segmentation, and customer segmentation.

10. However, the algorithm has some limitations, such as sensitivity to initial centroid locations and assumption of equal-sized clusters.
