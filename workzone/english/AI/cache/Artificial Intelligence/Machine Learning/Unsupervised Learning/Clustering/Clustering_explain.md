Clustering is a data mining technique that involves grouping a set of data points based on their similarities. The main goal of clustering is to identify patterns or structures within data sets that are related to each other.

An example of clustering can be seen in e-commerce websites that cluster consumer data based on their purchasing behavior. This helps retailers to understand their customers, identify the most profitable customers, and offer the right products to them. For instance, a retailer can cluster consumers in different categories based on their purchasing behavior or preferences, such as frequent buyers, occasional buyers, luxury buyers, or bargain hunters. By doing so, the retailer can offer personalized marketing campaigns to each cluster and improve sales.
