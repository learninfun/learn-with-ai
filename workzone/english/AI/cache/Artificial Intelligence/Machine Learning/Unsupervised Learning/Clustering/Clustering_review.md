1. What is the difference between hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering?
Answer: Hierarchical clustering creates a dendrogram, while K-means clustering calculates centroids and assigns data points to the nearest centroid.
2. What is the purpose of clustering in data analysis?
Answer: Clustering is used to group similar data points together, enabling effective data analysis, pattern recognition, and the identification of outliers.
3. How do you determine the optimal number of clusters in a data set?
Answer: There are several methods, including the elbow method and the silhouette method, which involve varying the number of clusters and calculating a metric, such as within-cluster sum of squares or silhouette coefficient, to find the optimal number.
4. What are some challenges or limitations of clustering analysis?
Answer: Some challenges include determining the appropriate distance metric and clustering algorithm for a given data set, choosing an appropriate number of clusters, and dealing with high-dimensional or noisy data. Clustering can also be sensitive to the initial starting position or random initialization.
5. How can clustering be effectively used in marketing or customer segmentation?
Answer: Clustering can be used to divide customers into groups based on shared characteristics, such as demographics or purchasing behavior, and to create targeted marketing campaigns or personalized recommendations for each cluster.
