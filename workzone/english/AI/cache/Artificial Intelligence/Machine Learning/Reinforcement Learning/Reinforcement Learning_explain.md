Reinforcement Learning (RL) refers to a type of machine learning algorithm that allows an agent to learn and make decisions based on trial-and-error experience in an environment. In other words, RL involves an agent interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or punishments based on its actions, and adjusting its behavior to maximize its rewards over time. 

One example of RL is training a computer program to play a game (such as chess or Go) against a human opponent. The program starts by making random moves and receives a reward (or penalty) based on the outcome of each game. Over time, the program learns which moves lead to more favorable outcomes and adjusts its strategy accordingly. Through trial and error, the program becomes better at the game until it is able to consistently beat human opponents.
