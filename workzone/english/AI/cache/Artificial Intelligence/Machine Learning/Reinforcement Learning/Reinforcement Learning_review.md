1. What is the difference between a value function and a policy in Reinforcement Learning? 
Answer: A value function predicts the value of a given state or action, while a policy specifies the best action to take in a given state.

2. What is the role of exploration in Reinforcement Learning?
Answer: Exploration allows agents to try out new actions and discover novel solutions to improve their policies.

3. What is the difference between on-policy and off-policy learning in Reinforcement Learning?
Answer: On-policy learning updates the policy based on the current behavior of the agent, while off-policy learning updates the policy based on the behavior of another agent.

4. What is the concept of Q-Learning in Reinforcement Learning?
Answer: Q-Learning is a model-free algorithm that learns the optimal action-value function without requiring a model of the environment.

5. What is the Curse of Dimensionality in Reinforcement Learning?
Answer: The Curse of Dimensionality refers to the difficulty of finding good policies in environments with high-dimensional states, due to the exponential increase in the number of possible states as the number of dimensions increases.
