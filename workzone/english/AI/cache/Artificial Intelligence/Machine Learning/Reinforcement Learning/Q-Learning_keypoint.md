1. Q-Learning is a machine learning algorithm that is used for solving the reinforcement learning problem.

2. It is a model-free algorithm that learns the optimal policy from experiences or interactions with the environment.

3. The algorithm uses a table or a matrix known as the Q-table, where the rows represent the different states and the columns represent the different actions.

4. The Q-table is updated iteratively using a formula known as the Q-learning update rule.

5. The update rule involves updating the Q-value for the current state and action by adding the discounted future rewards for the next state and the best action to take from that state.

6. The algorithm uses an exploration-exploitation strategy to balance between trying new actions and using the current best action.

7. Q-Learning is based on the principle of the Bellman equation that provides a way to recursively compute the optimal Q-value for each state-action pair.

8. The convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed if the learning rate and the discount factor are selected appropriately.

9. Q-Learning can be used for both discrete and continuous state and action spaces.

10. Applications of Q-Learning include robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems.
