1. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? 
Answer: Supervised learning involves labeled data that is used to train the machine learning model, while unsupervised learning uses unstructured data to identify patterns and relationships without prior knowledge of the potential outcomes.

2. What is overfitting in machine learning? 
Answer: Overfitting refers to a scenario where the machine learning model learns the training data too well and as a result, fails to generalize to new, unseen data.

3. What is the difference between precision and recall in a classification model evaluation? 
Answer: Precision refers to the proportion of true positive results among all positive results, while recall refers to the proportion of true positive results among all actual positive cases.

4. What is feature engineering in machine learning? 
Answer: Feature engineering is the process of selecting and extracting meaningful features from raw data to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of a machine learning model.

5. What is the difference between a parametric and non-parametric machine learning algorithm? 
Answer: A parametric algorithm makes assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data and fits a model based on those assumptions, while a non-parametric algorithm makes no assumptions and instead relies on statistical methods to learn patterns in the data.
