1. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
Answer: Supervised learning involves providing the machine learning algorithm with labeled training data, while unsupervised learning involves providing the algorithm with unlabeled data and allowing it to identify patterns and structure on its own.

2. What is overfitting in machine learning?
Answer: Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model is too complex and begins to fit to noise in the training data instead of the underlying patterns. This can result in poor performance on new, unseen data.

3. What are hyperparameters in machine learning?
Answer: Hyperparameters are settings that govern how a machine learning algorithm operates, such as the learning rate, regularization, and number of hidden layers in a neural network. These settings must be selected by the engineer and can significantly impact model performance.

4. What is the purpose of cross-validation in machine learning?
Answer: Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model on new data by splitting the data into multiple subsets and training the model on each subset while testing on the remaining data. This helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data.

5. What is the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning?
Answer: The bias-variance tradeoff refers to the balance between the complexity of a machine learning model and its ability to generalize to new data. Models with high bias are too simple and may underfit the data, while models with high variance are too complex and may overfit the data. The goal is to find a balance that results in good performance on new, unseen data.
