1. What is a validation set in machine learning?
Answer: A validation set is a subset of the training data that is used to tune model hyperparameters and evaluate model performance during the training process.

2. How is a validation set used in the training process?
Answer: A validation set is used to test the performance of the model during training, which allows for adjustments to be made to hyperparameters and prevent overfitting to the training data.

3. What is the difference between a validation set and a test set in machine learning?
Answer: A validation set is used during the training process to tune model hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, while a test set is used after training to evaluate the final performance of the model on unseen data.

4. What are some common techniques used for creating a validation set?
Answer: Some common techniques for creating a validation set include random sampling, stratified sampling, and time series splitting.

5. What are some best practices for using a validation set in machine learning?
Answer: Best practices for using a validation set include using the same random seed for reproducibility, using cross-validation to reduce variance, and minimizing data leakage between the training and validation sets.
