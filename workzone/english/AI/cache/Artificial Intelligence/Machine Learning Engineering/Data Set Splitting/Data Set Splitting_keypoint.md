1. Data set splitting involves dividing a larger data set into two or more smaller subsets for training and testing machine learning models.

2. The most common types of data set splitting are train-test split, k-fold cross-validation, and stratified sampling.

3. Train-test split involves randomly dividing the data into a training set and a testing set. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set.

4. K-fold cross-validation involves dividing the data into k equal subsets, using k-1 for training and the remaining subset for testing. This is repeated k times, with each subset used once for testing.

5. Stratified sampling ensures that the proportions of each class or category are maintained in each subset, which is important for imbalanced datasets.

6. The key objectives of data set splitting are to evaluate and compare the performance of different machine learning models, assess their generalization ability, and prevent overfitting.

7. The choice of the appropriate data set splitting method depends on several factors, such as the size and complexity of the dataset, the number of samples, or the number of classes.
