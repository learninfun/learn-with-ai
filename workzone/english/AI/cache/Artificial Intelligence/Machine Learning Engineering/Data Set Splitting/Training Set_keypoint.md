-The training set is a set of data used to train a machine learning model.
-It should be representative of the problem being solved and the population it serves.
-It is important to have sufficient and diverse data in the training set to avoid bias and overfitting.
-The training set is used to iteratively update and adjust the model until it produces the desired level of accuracy and performance.
-The performance of the model on the training set is not necessarily an accurate predictor of its performance on unseen data, which can be tested using a separate validation or test set.
-Proper preparation and cleaning of the training set can improve the quality and effectiveness of the model.
