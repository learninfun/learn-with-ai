1. The validation set is a subset of data used to assess the performance of a model during training.

2. It is an independent sample of data not used in the training set and not seen by the model during training.

3. The purpose of the validation set is to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model is too complex and tries to fit the training data too closely.

4. The validation set helps to tune the hyperparameters of the model, such as learning rate, batch size, and architecture.

5. The performance of the model on the validation set is used as an estimate of how well the model will perform on unseen data.

6. The validation set is usually split from the original data set, typically after the training set has been created.

7. A large validation set size ensures that the performance of the model on new data is reliable, while a small validation set size can lead to overfitting and poor generalization of the model. 

8. The validation set is used to make a final evaluation of the model before it is used for prediction on the test set or real-world data.
