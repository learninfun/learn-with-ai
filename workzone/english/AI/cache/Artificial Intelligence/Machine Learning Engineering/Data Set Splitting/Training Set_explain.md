A training set is a set of data used to train an artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning model. It is a subset of a larger dataset used to develop and tune the algorithms and models used to make predictions or classifications. The training set typically includes a large number of data examples along with known outcomes or labels associated with each example, which allows the model to learn to recognize patterns in the data.

For example, if an AI model is being developed to identify images of cats and dogs, a training set would be a collection of thousands of images of cats and dogs, along with labels identifying which images are cats and which are dogs. The algorithm uses this training set to learn the characteristics that differentiate cats from dogs and form a rule-based hypothesis. It then tests this hypothesis against a validation set to evaluate its performance and adjust its parameters. By repeating this process over many cycles, the AI model becomes increasingly accurate in the prediction of new images of cats and dogs.
