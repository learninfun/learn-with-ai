1) What is data set splitting?
Answer: Data set splitting is a technique in machine learning where a dataset is divided into two or more subsets, typically a training set and a testing set.
2) What is the purpose of splitting a data set?
Answer: The purpose of splitting a data set is to assess the performance of a machine learning algorithm on unseen data and to prevent overfitting.
3) What is the recommended ratio for splitting a data set into training and testing sets?
Answer: The recommended ratio for splitting a data set into training and testing sets is usually around 70-30 or 80-20, with the majority of the data being used for training and the remainder for testing.
4) How can cross-validation be used in conjunction with data set splitting?
Answer: Cross-validation can be used to further validate the performance of a machine learning algorithm by splitting the data into multiple sets and testing the algorithm on each subset.
5) What other techniques can be used for data set splitting besides simple random sampling?
Answer: Other techniques for data set splitting include stratified sampling, where the subsets maintain the same proportions of classes as the original data set, and time-series splitting, where the subsets are split based on time periods.
