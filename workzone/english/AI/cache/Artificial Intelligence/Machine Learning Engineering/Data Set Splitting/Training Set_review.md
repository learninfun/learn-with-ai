1. What is a training set?
Answer: A training set is a collection of data used to train and develop machine learning models.

2. How is a training set different from a validation set?
Answer: A training set is used to train a machine learning model, while a validation set is used to evaluate the performance of the model during training.

3. What factors should be considered when creating a training set?
Answer: The size and quality of the data, the diversity of the data, and the balance between classes or categories are all important factors to consider when creating a training set.

4. Can a training set be too large?
Answer: Yes, a training set can be too large if it contains redundant or irrelevant data that may negatively impact the performance of the machine learning model.

5. What is overfitting in the context of a training set?
Answer: Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training set too well, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data. This can happen when the model is too complex or the training set is too small.
