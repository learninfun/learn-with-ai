1. Question: What is the difference between accuracy and precision when evaluating a model?
Answer: Accuracy is the percentage of correct predictions made by a model, while precision is the proportion of true positive predictions among all the positive predictions made by the model.

2. Question: How is the F1 score calculated, and what is its significance in evaluating classification models?
Answer: The F1 score is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it represents the balance between the two metrics. It is particularly useful in situations where both false positives and false negatives are equally undesirable.

3. Question: What is cross-validation, and why is it important in model evaluation?
Answer: Cross-validation is a technique that involves splitting a dataset into multiple subsets, training a model on some of them, and evaluating it on the remaining subset. This allows for a more reliable estimate of a model's performance, since it takes into account the variability in the data and reduces the risk of overfitting.

4. Question: What are some common metrics used to evaluate regression models, and what do they measure?
Answer: Mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared are some common metrics used to evaluate regression models. MSE and RMSE measure the average difference between predicted and actual values, while R-squared represents the proportion of variance in the data that is explained by the model.

5. Question: What is the purpose of a confusion matrix in evaluating a classification model, and how is it used?
Answer: A confusion matrix is a table that shows the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions made by a classification model. It is used to compute various performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and to visualize where the model is making errors.
