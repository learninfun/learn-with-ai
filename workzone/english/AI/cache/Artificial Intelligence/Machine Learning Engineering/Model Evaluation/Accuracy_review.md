1. What is accuracy in the context of data analysis?
Answer: Accuracy is the measure of how close a result or measurement is to the true value or expected value.

2. What are some factors that can affect the accuracy of a measurement or result?
Answer: Environmental factors, instrumental factors, and human factors can all affect the accuracy of a measurement or result.

3. What is the difference between accuracy and precision?
Answer: Accuracy refers to how close a measurement or result is to the true value, while precision refers to how consistent and reproducible a measurement is.

4. How can you improve the accuracy of a measurement or result?
Answer: Several methods can be used to improve accuracy, including calibrating instruments, using appropriate sample sizes, reducing sources of error, and repeating measurements.

5. What are some common sources of error that can reduce the accuracy of a measurement or result?
Answer: Common sources of error include measurement bias, random errors, systematic errors, and environmental factors such as temperature and humidity.
