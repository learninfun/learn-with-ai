1. What is the formula for calculating F1 Score?
Answer: F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

2. How does F1 Score differ from accuracy in evaluating machine learning models?
Answer: F1 Score takes into account both precision and recall, while accuracy only measures the number of correct predictions.

3. If a model has a precision of 0.8 and a recall of 0.6, what is the F1 Score?
Answer: F1 Score = 2 * (0.8 * 0.6) / (0.8 + 0.6) = 0.685

4. Is a higher F1 Score always better?
Answer: Not necessarily. A high F1 Score indicates good balance between precision and recall, but the optimal value for the F1 Score depends on the specific problem and domain.

5. How can you improve the F1 Score of a model?
Answer: You can improve the F1 Score by improving either precision or recall. This can be achieved by adjusting the model's parameters, adding more training data, or using different feature selection techniques.
