Accuracy is the degree to which a measurement, calculation, or estimation reflects the true value of what it purports to measure. It is a measure of how close the results of something are to the true value, which is also known as precision. For example, if a person's weight is measured as 70kg, and their actual weight is 70kg, then the measurement is accurate. However, if the measurement is 68kg, then it is not accurate because it is not reflecting the true value of the person's weight. Similarly, if a thermometer measures the temperature of water to be 100 degrees Celsius, but the actual temperature is 98 degrees Celsius, then the thermometer is not accurate.
