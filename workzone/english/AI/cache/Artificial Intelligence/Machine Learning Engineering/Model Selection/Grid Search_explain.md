Grid Search is a technique used in machine learning for hyperparameter optimization. Hyperparameters refer to the parameters that are set before the learning process begins and are not learned from data. In Grid Search, a set of hyperparameters is specified along with the range of values that each parameter can take. The algorithm then evaluates the performance of the model for each combination of hyperparameters, creating a grid.

For example, suppose we are building a decision tree model to classify images of cats and dogs. We need to choose the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of each tree, and the minimum number of instances required to split a node. We could use Grid Search to help us choose these hyperparameters by specifying a range of values for each hyperparameter. Suppose we choose to evaluate the number of trees from 50 to 200, the maximum depth from 5 to 15, and the minimum number of instances from 2 to 20. Grid Search would evaluate our model for each combination of these hyperparameter values, such as 50 trees, depth of 5, and minimum instances of 2, 50 trees, depth of 5, and minimum instances of 4, and so on. The algorithm would then determine which combination of hyperparameters resulted in the best performance of the model.
