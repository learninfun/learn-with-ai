1. Cross-validation is a statistical technique used to evaluate how well a predictive model can generalize to new, unseen data. 

2. The basic idea of cross-validation is to split the available data into two or more subsets: one subset is used to train the model, while the other subsets are used to test it. 

3. The most common type of cross-validation is k-fold cross-validation, where the data is split into k equally sized subsets (or folds). 

4. For each fold, the model is trained on the remaining k-1 folds and tested on the held-out fold. This process is repeated k times, with each fold used once as the validation set. 

5. The performance of the model is evaluated by calculating the average of the test results across all folds. 

6. Cross-validation helps to overcome overfitting, a common problem in machine learning where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. 

7. Cross-validation can also be used to compare the performance of different models or to tune the hyperparameters of a model. 

8. However, cross-validation can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets or complex models. 

9. There are different variations of cross-validation, such as leave-one-out cross-validation or stratified k-fold cross-validation, that can be used depending on the specific problem and the available data. 

10. Overall, cross-validation is an important tool for evaluating and improving the performance of predictive models in machine learning.
