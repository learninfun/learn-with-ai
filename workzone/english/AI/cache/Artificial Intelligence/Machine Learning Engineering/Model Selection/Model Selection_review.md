1. What is the purpose of model selection? 

Answer: The purpose of model selection is to choose the best model that accurately represents the relationship between the variables in the dataset.

2. What are the common methods used in model selection? 

Answer: The common methods used in model selection include stepwise regression, Lasso, Ridge regression, and cross-validation.

3. How does the AIC criterion help in model selection? 

Answer: AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) is a statistical measure that compares the goodness of fit of different models. Lower AIC values indicate better model performance, and hence, it is used to help in selecting the best model.

4. How can overfitting be avoided during model selection? 

Answer: Overfitting can be avoided by using techniques such as regularization, cross-validation, and data splitting. These methods help in identifying the optimal model that balances model complexity and predictive performance.

5. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using multiple models for model selection? 

Answer: The advantages of using multiple models for model selection include a better understanding of the data and better model performance. However, the disadvantages include increased complexity, longer computation time, and an increased risk of overfitting.
