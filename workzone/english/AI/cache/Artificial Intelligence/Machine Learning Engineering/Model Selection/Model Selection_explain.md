Model selection is the process of choosing the best machine learning model from among different models for a given problem based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, mean squared error, etc. The goal is to select the model that best fits the data and performs well on new data sets.

For example, suppose we are working on a classification problem to predict whether a customer will buy a product or not based on their age, income, and education. We can train different models such as decision tree, logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, etc., on the training data and evaluate their performance on the validation data using the accuracy metric. We select the model with the highest accuracy as the best model and use it to make predictions on new data.
