Cross-validation is a method used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. It involves partitioning a dataset into complementary subsets, where one subset is used for training the model and the other subset for testing its performance. The process is repeated several times using different partitions in order to get more reliable estimates of the model accuracy.

For example, let's say we have a dataset of 1000 patients and we want to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on several input variables such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol level, etc. We can partition the dataset into two subsets - 700 patients for training and 300 patients for testing. We can use the training subset to train our model and then evaluate its performance using the testing subset. However, this may not provide us with a reliable estimate of the model's accuracy, as the testing set may contain certain patterns or trends that were not present in the training set. 

To overcome this issue, we can use cross-validation by randomly splitting the dataset into K partitions (e.g. K=5 or K=10). We can then run the model K times, choosing a different partition each time as the testing set and the remaining partitions as the training set. This allows us to obtain K estimates of the model accuracy, which we can then average to get a more reliable estimate of the model's performance. Cross-validation helps to reduce overfitting of the model and ensures that its accuracy is not distorted by chance random splits of the dataset.
