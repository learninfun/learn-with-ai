1. What is the purpose of cross-validation in machine learning?
Answer: Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate model performance by testing the model on new data to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.

2. What are the different types of cross-validation methods?
Answer: The most common cross-validation methods are k-fold cross-validation, leave-one-out cross-validation, and stratified cross-validation.

3. How does k-fold cross-validation work?
Answer: In k-fold cross-validation, the data is divided into k subsets, or folds. The model is trained on k-1 folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, with each fold serving as the test set once.

4. What is overfitting, and how can cross-validation help prevent it?
Answer: Overfitting occurs when a model is trained too well on the training data and does not generalize well to new data. Cross-validation can help prevent overfitting by testing the model on new data during the validation process.

5. What are some limitations of cross-validation?
Answer: Cross-validation can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets. It can also be affected by biases and imbalances in the data. Additionally, cross-validation may not be suitable for all types of models, such as those with a time series or spatial dependence.
