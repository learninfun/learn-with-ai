1. What is Grid Search in machine learning?
Answer: Grid Search is a hyperparameter tuning technique used to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters for a given model. It involves training a model with different sets of hyperparameters and selecting the combination that gives the best performance.

2. What is the main advantage of using Grid Search?
Answer: The main advantage of using Grid Search is that it is an exhaustive search technique that tests all possible combinations of hyperparameters. As a result, it helps to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters that would have been overlooked otherwise.

3. What are the hyperparameters that can be tuned using Grid Search?
Answer: The hyperparameters that can be tuned using Grid Search depend on the type of model being trained. For example, the hyperparameters for a Decision Tree model could include the maximum depth of the tree, the maximum number of leaf nodes, and the minimum number of samples required to split a node.

4. Does Grid Search guarantee finding the optimal hyperparameters?
Answer: Grid Search does not guarantee finding the optimal hyperparameters but it helps to find a good set of hyperparameters. In some cases, there may be multiple combinations of hyperparameters that give similar performance and it is up to the data scientist to choose the best set based on their knowledge and experience.

5. How can you use results from Grid Search to improve your model performance?
Answer: The results from Grid Search can be used to improve model performance by selecting the best set of hyperparameters for training the final model. Additionally, the results can also help to identify which hyperparameters are most important for the model performance and guide further experimentation.
