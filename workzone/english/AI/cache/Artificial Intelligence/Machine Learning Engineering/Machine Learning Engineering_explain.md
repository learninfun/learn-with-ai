Machine Learning Engineering is the application of machine learning techniques to build and optimize production-grade, scalable models to solve real-world problems. It involves the development of sophisticated algorithms, building infrastructure, and integrating models with production systems to deliver value to users.

An example of machine learning engineering could be a recommendation system for an online store. The system uses historical data on customer purchases to generate real-time product recommendations. The machine learning engineers design and implement algorithms that identify patterns in customer data and develop models that can predict customer preferences based on those patterns. They then deploy these models to a production environment, testing and tuning them to ensure that they generate accurate, customized suggestions for each customer. The machine learning engineers also integrate these models with the rest of the online store's infrastructure, ensuring that the recommendations are delivered smoothly and efficiently, and that the system can scale to accommodate a growing number of users.
