Privacy refers to the state of being free from public scrutiny, intrusion or interference with one's personal affairs, and the right to control how one's personal information is used and shared. 

For example, a person's medical records are protected under privacy laws to prevent unauthorized access by anyone who does not have a legitimate reason or authority to access them. This ensures that a patient's personal health information is kept confidential and not shared with anyone without their consent. Another example is online privacy, where individuals have the right to control how their personal information is used and shared by websites and social media platforms. This includes personal information such as name, email address, phone number, location, and browsing history.
