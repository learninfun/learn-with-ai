1. What is the definition of an error in the context of statistical analysis?
Answer: An error refers to the discrepancy between the true value and the estimation from a model or sample.

2. What is fairness in statistical decision-making and why is it important?
Answer: Fairness refers to the equitable treatment of individuals or groups in regards to the application of statistical models or decision-making processes. It is important to ensure that statistical analyses and decisions do not perpetuate biases or inequalities.

3. What is selection bias and how can it impact the fairness of a statistical analysis?
Answer: Selection bias occurs when the sample or population under study is not representative of the larger population, which can lead to biased results that are not generalizable. This can impact fairness by excluding specific groups from the analysis or favoring certain groups over others.

4. What is the role of transparency in ensuring fairness in statistical decision-making?
Answer: Transparency refers to the openness and accessibility of information and processes in the analysis and decision-making processes. This is important for ensuring that biases are identified and addressed, and that outcomes can be replicated and verified.

5. What are some strategies for improving the fairness of statistical models and decision-making processes?
Answer: Some strategies include ensuring diverse representation in the development and testing of models, using multiple sources of data and methods to reduce bias, and implementing checks and balances to identify and address biases in the analysis and decision-making processes.
