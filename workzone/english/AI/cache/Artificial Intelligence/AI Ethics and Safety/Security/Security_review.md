1. What is a firewall and how does it protect against security threats?
Answer: A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic. It acts as a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the internet, and blocks unauthorized access to the network.

2. What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and why is it important for security?
Answer: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a security process in which a user provides two different authentication factors to verify their identity. This can include something the user knows (such as a password) and something they have (such as a mobile phone or security token). 2FA is important for security as it adds an extra layer of protection and makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive information.

3. What is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack and how can it be prevented?
Answer: A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is an attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a computer system or network by overwhelming it with a flood of traffic or requests. This can cause the system or network to crash or become inaccessible to legitimate users. DoS attacks can be prevented by implementing proper security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and limiting the number of requests from a single IP address.

4. What is phishing and how can it be identified and avoided?
Answer: Phishing is a type of social engineering attack in which a cybercriminal attempts to steal sensitive information by disguising themselves as a trustworthy entity (such as a bank or email provider) and convincing the victim to provide personal information or login credentials. Phishing can be identified and avoided by being suspicious of unsolicited email or messages, verifying the legitimacy of the sender, and never providing personal information or clicking on links in unsolicited emails.

5. What is encryption and why is it important for security?
Answer: Encryption is the process of encoding information to make it unreadable without the proper decryption key. It is important for security as it can protect sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized parties. Encrypted data is also more secure when transmitted over the internet, as it is difficult for hackers to intercept and read the data.
