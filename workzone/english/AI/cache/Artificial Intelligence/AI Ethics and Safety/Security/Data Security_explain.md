Data security is a process of protecting digital data from unauthorized access or theft. It involves implementing various security measures such as encryption, access controls, firewalls, and monitoring systems to ensure that the data remains intact and confidential.

An example of data security could be the following: A healthcare organization takes several security measures to protect their patients' medical records. They encrypt the data, enforce strong passwords for accessing the records, implement access controls, and regularly monitor the system to detect any unauthorized access. They also have a disaster recovery plan in place to ensure that the data remains accessible even in case of a system failure or a natural disaster. With these measures in place, the healthcare organization can ensure the confidentiality of their patients' information and comply with legal and regulatory requirements.
