System security refers to the measures and methods used to protect computer systems and networks from unauthorized access, theft, damage, or other threats. It includes various policies, procedures, and technologies that help to prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to critical assets or data, and to detect and respond to any security breaches or incidents.

An example of system security would be the use of firewalls and intrusion detection systems to prevent unauthorized access to a corporate network. Firewalls can block incoming traffic from unknown IP addresses or restrict specific types of traffic, while intrusion detection systems can monitor network activity for suspicious behavior and alert administrators if an attack or unauthorized access attempt is detected. Additional security measures such as access control policies, encryption, and regular software updates can also enhance system security and protect against various types of cyber threats.
