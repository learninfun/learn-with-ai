Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world around them. This involves using algorithms and pattern recognition technology to analyze and identify images or videos, and then processing that information for various applications.

A common example of computer vision is facial recognition. This technology uses complex algorithms and neural networks to identify and classify human faces in images or videos. Applications of this technology include security systems, identity verification, and social media tagging.

Another example is object recognition, which involves identifying and classifying different objects in an image or video. This technology is used in fields such as autonomous vehicles, where computers must be able to recognize road signs, people, and other vehicles in order to navigate and make decisions.
