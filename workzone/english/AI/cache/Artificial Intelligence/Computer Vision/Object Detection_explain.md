Object detection refers to the process of identifying and localizing objects within an image or video frame. It involves detecting the presence of objects in an image, classifying them, and determining their location in the image. Object detection is used in a wide range of applications including self-driving cars, surveillance, and robotics.

An example of object detection is the use of a camera to detect and recognize faces. The camera captures the image of a person's face, and the object detection algorithm analyzes the features of the face, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth to identify a face. The algorithm can then locate and track the face in real-time as it moves within the camera's field of view. This type of technology is commonly used in security systems, biometric systems, and social media applications.
