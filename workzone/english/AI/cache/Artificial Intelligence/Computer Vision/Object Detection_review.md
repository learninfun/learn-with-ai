1) What is the difference between object detection and object classification?
Answer: Object detection not only identifies what objects are present in an image but also locates them through a bounding box. In contrast, object classification only identifies what objects are present in an image without localizing them.

2) What are some popular object detection algorithms?
Answer: Popular object detection algorithms include YOLO (You Only Look Once), Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network), and SSD (Single Shot Detection).

3) What does non-maximum suppression do in object detection?
Answer: Non-maximum suppression is a post-processing step in object detection that removes duplicate detection results. It keeps the highest-scoring detection and discards any overlapping detections.

4) What is the trade-off between speed and accuracy in object detection?
Answer: Generally, faster object detection models sacrifice accuracy and vice versa. The choice between speed and accuracy depends on the use case and available hardware.

5) How does transfer learning help with object detection?
Answer: Transfer learning involves using a pre-trained model to improve object detection on a new dataset with similar objects. It saves computation time and can lead to higher accuracy.
