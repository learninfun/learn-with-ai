Edge detection is a process used in digital image processing to identify and locate sharp discontinuities in an image. The process involves detecting drastic changes in color, texture, or intensity levels in adjacent pixels. The goal of edge detection is to isolate and extract the edges of objects in an image, which are the regions where there are significant changes in intensity levels.

An example of edge detection is when a digital image of a car is processed to identify the edges of the car. The edge detection algorithm will locate and extract the edges of the car, including its contours and details such as headlights, bumper, and windows. These edges can be useful for various image processing applications, such as object recognition, segmentation, and tracking. Other examples of edge detection applied in different contexts include medical imaging, surveillance, and robotics.
