1. How are SIFT features extracted from an image?
Answer: SIFT features are extracted by first identifying interest points or keypoints in an image, then computing descriptors for each keypoint based on the local gradient orientations.

2. What is the key advantage of using SIFT features over other feature extraction techniques?
Answer: The key advantage of SIFT features is their robustness to various image transformations and changes in lighting conditions, making them suitable for a wide range of real-world applications.

3. How does the scale-invariant nature of SIFT features help in matching objects across different images?
Answer: SIFT features are scale-invariant, meaning they can detect the same object at different scales. This helps in matching objects across different images where the object may appear at different sizes or resolutions.

4. What are some common applications of SIFT features in computer vision?
Answer: SIFT features are commonly used for object recognition, image retrieval, 3D reconstruction, and video analysis.

5. How does the orientation of SIFT features affect their matching accuracy?
Answer: The orientation of SIFT features is important for accurate matching, as it helps to align the descriptors of two corresponding keypoints. Without proper orientation estimation, the matching accuracy may drop significantly.
