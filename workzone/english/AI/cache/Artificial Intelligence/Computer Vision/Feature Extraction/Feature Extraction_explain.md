Feature extraction is the process of identifying and extracting important information or characteristics from raw data. These features can then be used to train machine learning models for tasks such as classification, clustering, and prediction.

For example, in image recognition, feature extraction involves identifying important visual elements of an image such as edges, colors, shapes, and textures. These features can be extracted using techniques like principal component analysis, wavelet transforms, or convolutional neural networks. Once the features are extracted, they can be used to train a machine learning model to classify images based on their content. This approach is widely used in applications such as facial recognition, object detection, and medical imaging.
