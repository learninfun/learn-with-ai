1. What is edge detection and what purpose does it serve in image processing?
2. What are the most common edge detection techniques and how do they differ from one another?
3. How do edge detection algorithms handle noise in the image? 
4. How does thresholding affect the accuracy of edge detection results?
5. Can edge detection accurately identify all types of edges in an image, or are there limitations to the approach?
