1) What is the purpose of edge detection in image processing?
Answer: The purpose of edge detection in image processing is to identify and localize the boundaries between different regions in an image.

2) What are some common techniques used for edge detection?
Answer: Some common techniques for edge detection include the Sobel operator, Canny edge detector, and Laplacian of Gaussian filter.

3) How does the Sobel operator work for edge detection?
Answer: The Sobel operator applies two matrix kernels to an image to compute the gradient intensity values in the x and y directions. The resulting gradient magnitude values identify the edges in the image.

4) What is non-maximum suppression in the context of edge detection?
Answer: Non-maximum suppression is a technique used to refine the edge detection results by suppressing any non-maximum values in the gradient image that are not part of the actual edges.

5) What are some challenges or limitations of edge detection algorithms?
Answer: Some challenges or limitations of edge detection algorithms include noise and clutter in the image, variability in edge strength and thickness, and the potential for false positives or missed edges.
