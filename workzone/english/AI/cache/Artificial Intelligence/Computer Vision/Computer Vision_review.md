1. What is the difference between object detection and object recognition in computer vision? 
Answer: Object detection involves identifying the presence of objects in an image or video and providing their location and dimensions, while object recognition involves identifying the type of object, such as distinguishing between a car and a pedestrian.

2. What is optical flow in computer vision and how is it used? 
Answer: Optical flow is the pattern of movement of pixels between consecutive frames in a video, which can be used to estimate the motion of objects in the scene. It can be used for tasks such as tracking moving objects or analyzing the motion of fluids.

3. What is image segmentation and how is it used in computer vision? 
Answer: Image segmentation is the process of dividing an image into multiple regions or segments based on certain criteria, such as color or texture. It can be used for tasks such as object detection, image classification, and image editing.

4. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in computer vision? 
Answer: Supervised learning involves training a machine learning model using labeled data, while unsupervised learning uses unlabelled data to identify patterns or clusters in the data. In computer vision, supervised learning can be used for tasks such as image classification, while unsupervised learning can be used for tasks such as image clustering.

5. What is a convolutional neural network (CNN) and how is it used in computer vision? 
Answer: A convolutional neural network is a type of deep learning model that is designed to process images by applying convolutional filters to extract features from the image. It is commonly used for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.
