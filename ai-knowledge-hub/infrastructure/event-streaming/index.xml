give me five question about Kafka ChatGPT answer:
What inspired Kafka to write such surrealist and absurdist works? What is the significance of the recurring themes of guilt, alienation, and pervasive bureaucracy in Kafka&amp;rsquo;s writing? How do Kafka&amp;rsquo;s works reflect his personal struggles and anxieties about his place in society? How have literary critics&amp;rsquo; interpretations of Kafka&amp;rsquo;s work changed over time? What impact has Kafka had on modern literature and society, and why does his work continue to be so widely read and discussed today?</description></item></channel></rss>
