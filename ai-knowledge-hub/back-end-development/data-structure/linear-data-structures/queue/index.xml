give me five question about Circular Queue ChatGPT answer:
What is a circular queue and how does it differ from a regular queue? Can a circular queue be implemented using an array? If so, what are the advantages and disadvantages? How can we efficiently handle overflow and underflow in a circular queue? Can we implement a circular queue using a linked list? If so, how would it be different from an array-based implementation?</description></item><item><title/><link>https://learninfun.github.io/learn-with-ai/ai-knowledge-hub/back-end-development/data-structure/linear-data-structures/queue/linear-queue/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learninfun.github.io/learn-with-ai/ai-knowledge-hub/back-end-development/data-structure/linear-data-structures/queue/linear-queue/</guid><description>Preview User ask:
