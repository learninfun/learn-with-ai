give me five question about Breadth-First Search ChatGPT answer:
What is Breadth-First Search (BFS) and what is it used for? How does BFS traverse a graph or tree and what is its time complexity? What is the difference between BFS and Depth-First Search (DFS)? Can BFS be used to find the shortest path in a weighted graph? If yes, how? What are some common applications of BFS in real-world problems?</description></item></channel></rss>
