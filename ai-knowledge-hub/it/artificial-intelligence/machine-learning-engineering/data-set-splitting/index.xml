give me five question about Training Set ChatGPT answer:
What is a training set and why is it important? How do you select a representative and diverse training set? What is the difference between a training set and a validation set? How do you measure the performance of a model trained on a training set? Can you use a small training set to train a machine learning model effectively?</description></item><item><title>Validation Set</title><link>https://learninfun.github.io/learn-with-ai/ai-knowledge-hub/it/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning-engineering/data-set-splitting/validation-set/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learninfun.github.io/learn-with-ai/ai-knowledge-hub/it/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning-engineering/data-set-splitting/validation-set/</guid><description>Preview User ask:
