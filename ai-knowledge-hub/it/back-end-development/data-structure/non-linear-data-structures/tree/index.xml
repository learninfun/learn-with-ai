give me five question about Huffman Tree ChatGPT answer:
How does a Huffman tree compress data? How do you create a Huffman tree for a set of data? How does the frequency of characters in the data impact the resulting Huffman tree? Can a Huffman tree be used to decompress data as well as compress it? How does the size of the Huffman tree compare to other compression algorithms, such as LZW or RLE?</description></item><item><title/><link>https://learninfun.github.io/learn-with-ai/ai-knowledge-hub/it/back-end-development/data-structure/non-linear-data-structures/tree/n-ary-tree/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learninfun.github.io/learn-with-ai/ai-knowledge-hub/it/back-end-development/data-structure/non-linear-data-structures/tree/n-ary-tree/</guid><description>Preview User ask:
