give me five question about Topological Sort ChatGPT answer:
What is a topological sort and how does it work? How is topological sort used in real-world applications such as scheduling and project management? What are the different algorithms for performing topological sort? Can a topological sort be performed on a graph with cycles? If not, why? How does the time complexity of topological sort vary depending on the algorithm used and the size of the graph?</description></item></channel></rss>
