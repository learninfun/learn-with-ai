Supervised Use: Students should be supervised when using ChatGPT to ensure they are using it correctly and to avoid negative effects. Think First, Then Ask: If you rely too much on AI without thinking, it may decrease your ability to think independently. Review After Asking: After asking a question, you should still digest, absorb, and judge its correctness on your own. Simplified Answers: If the answer is too difficult to understand, you can ask ChatGPT to simplify its explanation.</description></item><item><title>Cheat Sheet: Coding with ChatGPT</title><link>https://learninfun.github.io/learn-with-ai/cheat-sheet/chatgpt/coding-with-ai/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learninfun.github.io/learn-with-ai/cheat-sheet/chatgpt/coding-with-ai/</guid><description>Concept When developing programs, we need to do many things, including setting up the environment, learning languages, writing code, testing, and debugging.
These tasks require a lot of time and effort, but if we make good use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, we can speed up the process.
For example, AI can help us automatically generate code, optimize code, and debug automatically, all of which can significantly improve our development efficiency and quality.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://learninfun.github.io/learn-with-ai/ai-knowledge-hub/it/back-end-development/algorithm/algorithm-design-techniques/backtracking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learninfun.github.io/learn-with-ai/ai-knowledge-hub/it/back-end-development/algorithm/algorithm-design-techniques/backtracking/</guid><description>Preview User ask:
