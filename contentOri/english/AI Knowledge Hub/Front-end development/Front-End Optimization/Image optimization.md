Image optimization refers to the technique of reducing the size of images used on a website or an application, without diminishing their visual quality, to improve website loading speed and reduce bandwidth usage. The optimization of images involves image compression, resizing, and formatting to achieve an optimal balance between image quality and file size.

For example, when optimizing an image, a developer can compress the file size of a high-resolution image by reducing its pixels and color depth, thus reducing the overall page size, which results in faster loading times. Additionally, a developer can use the appropriate image format (JPEG, PNG, GIF, or SVG), smaller image sizes and appropriate image file names and alt tags to further optimize images for web content. This optimization not only improves the user's experience but also reduces data usage on mobile devices as well. Overall, image optimization is a critical factor in improving website speed and web visitors' experience.
