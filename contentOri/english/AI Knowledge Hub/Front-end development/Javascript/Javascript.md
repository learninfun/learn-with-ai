JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is widely used for developing interactive web pages and web applications. JavaScript is executed in the browser and can manipulate HTML and CSS to create dynamic pages. It also allows for the creation of interactive features and effects like animations, pop-up boxes, and other user interactions.

One example of JavaScript in action is the Google Maps API, which uses JavaScript to display maps, markers, and other features. With Google Maps, users can navigate and interact with interactive maps, searching for directions, and zooming in and out of maps. Another example is online forms that use JavaScript to validate input fields, check for errors, and provide feedback to the user.

1. What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?
Answer: The == operator compares only the value of the two operands, while the === operator compares both the value and the datatype of the two operands.

2. How can you prevent a function from executing if a specific condition is not met in JavaScript?
Answer: You can use an if statement to check the condition, and use the return statement to exit the function if the condition is not met.

3. What does the 'this' keyword refer to in JavaScript?
Answer: The 'this' keyword is a reference to the object that the function is a method of, or the global object if the function is not part of an object.

4. What is the difference between let and var in JavaScript?
Answer: The main difference between let and var is that let is block-scoped, while var is function-scoped. This means that variables declared with let are only accessible within the block they are declared in, while variables declared with var can be accessed within the entire function.

5. How can you add an element to the beginning of an array in JavaScript?
Answer: You can use the unshift() method to add an element to the beginning of an array. For example, arr.unshift(element); will add 'element' to the beginning of the 'arr' array.
