CSS selector is a pattern or a query used to select HTML elements on a web page and apply styles to them. A CSS selector can be used to target specific elements based on their tag name, class, ID, attribute, or any combination of these factors.

For example, let's say we want to target all paragraph elements on a webpage and align their text to the center. The CSS selector for this task would be:

```
p {
  text-align: center;
}
```

In this example, the selector "p" selects all the paragraph elements on the webpage and applies the "text-align" style property, which centers the text within the paragraph. Other examples of CSS selectors include:

- class selector: selects all elements with a specific class name, e.g. ".header"
- ID selector: selects a specific element with a unique ID name, e.g. "#main-content"
- attribute selector: selects elements based on their attributes, e.g. [type="submit"]
- descendant selector: selects elements that are descendants of a parent element, e.g. #nav ul li.
 
Overall, CSS selectors provide a powerful way to target and apply styles to specific elements on a webpage.
