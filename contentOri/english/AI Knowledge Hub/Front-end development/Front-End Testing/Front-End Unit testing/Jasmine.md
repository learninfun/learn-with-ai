Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. It provides a readable, user-friendly syntax that allows developers to write automated tests for their applications.

The main idea behind Jasmine is to describe expected behavior in a clear and concise language. This makes it easier to write and maintain test cases, as well as to understand the intended functionalities of the code being tested.

Here's an example of a Jasmine test case:

```javascript
describe("Calculator", function() {
  var calc;

  beforeEach(function() {
    calc = new Calculator();
  });

  describe("addition", function() {
    it("should be able to add two numbers", function() {
      expect(calc.addition(2, 3)).toEqual(5);
    });

    it("should return NaN if one of the inputs is not a number", function() {
      expect(calc.addition("2", 3)).toBeNaN();
    });
  });

  describe("subtraction", function() {
    it("should be able to subtract two numbers", function() {
      expect(calc.subtraction(5, 3)).toEqual(2);
    });

    it("should return NaN if one of the inputs is not a number", function() {
      expect(calc.subtraction(5, "3")).toBeNaN();
    });
  });
});
```

In this test case, we're testing a Calculator object that has two methods, addition and subtraction. We're checking that these methods behave as expected by testing their output against known values. We're also testing that the methods return NaN (Not a Number) when non-numeric input is passed to them. 

Using Jasmine, we can run these tests automatically every time we make changes to our code, ensuring that it continues to behave as expected.   

## Keypoint

List the key points of Jasmine
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. Jasmine is a testing framework for JavaScript that allows developers to write tests for their applications easily.

2. Jasmine provides a clean syntax for writing test specifications, which are called "specs," making it easy to read and understand what each test is doing.

3. Specs are grouped together in a "suite," which can include one or more specs.

4. Jasmine provides a range of matchers that developers can use to test their applications, including equality, comparison, and type checking.

5. Developers can also use Jasmine to test asynchronous code, such as functions that rely on data from an external API.

6. Jasmine includes an easy-to-use setup and teardown functionality that makes it easy to write tests that have predictable results.

7. Jasmine can run tests in a browser or on the command line, making it easy to integrate into any development workflow.

8. Jasmine is extensively documented, with a large community of developers who contribute plugins, extensions, and support to the framework.
