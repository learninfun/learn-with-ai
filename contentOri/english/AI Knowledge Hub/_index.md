## High level concept
Using batch queries with AI can easily provide you with the framework and content of a specific knowledge area. This artificial intelligence technology can quickly extract the required knowledge points system from a vast knowledge base through automation and batch processing, and delve into each knowledge point, providing detailed explanations, key points, quiz questions, and reference materials.

When you use this AI, it can automatically extract the relevant knowledge points system from the knowledge base and provide relevant explanations, key points, quiz questions, and reference materials based on your needs. For example, if you need to learn a specific language, the AI will extract the knowledge points system for that language from the relevant knowledge base and provide you with detailed explanations, key points, quiz questions, and reference materials for each knowledge point.

Using batch queries with AI, you can easily obtain detailed and organized knowledge content without spending a lot of time and effort. The rapid and automated nature of this AI technology can greatly improve your learning efficiency, allowing you to quickly master the necessary knowledge.

## How to explore and extract knowledge with ChatGPT?
- Noun definition
  - [AA] is a middle-level knowledge node that still needs to be expanded.
  - [OO] is a leaf node that requires a deeper understanding of its content.
- Get the framework from ChatGPT
  - list the knowledge points related to [OO], presented in a non-repetitive tree structure and expanded to the fifth level.
- Use program to traverse all the knowledge points, and ask following questions
  - give me five question about [OO]
  - Explain [OO] and give an example
  - List the key points of [OO]
  - Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about [OO]
  - List the relevant introduction webpages about [OO]

## Explain the detail

ChatGPT is a powerful natural language processing technology that can efficiently answer various knowledge-based and quiz questions, thanks to its powerful deep learning model and vast training data.
Its knowledge base covers various topics, including natural sciences, humanities, engineering, and more, and has reached a fairly rich and comprehensive level.
ChatGPT has a sufficient understanding of these knowledge areas and can effectively organize them to facilitate users' quick understanding and learning.

If we use ChatGPT to query a list of knowledge points for a specific topic and present it in a tree structure, we can obtain a deep understanding of the knowledge system and relationship context from ChatGPT.
This query method can quickly establish a knowledge framework to help people understand the system structure and key points of the knowledge.
Through this method, we can learn and understand knowledge more efficiently and verify our mastery of knowledge in a timely manner during the learning process, thereby better achieving the application and transformation of knowledge.

Exploring and traversing knowledge systems automatically using programs can quickly establish ChatGPT's understanding framework for that knowledge. With this framework, we can more quickly and systematically understand and master knowledge, which is helpful for comprehensive application and understanding of knowledge. At the same time, using this framework for self-verification and review can more quickly and accurately verify whether our understanding of knowledge is correct, further improving knowledge learning efficiency and results.

However, during the process of expanding the tree of knowledge points, there may be the following issues:

1. ChatGPT may not expand deep enough for specific knowledge points. In this case, manual intervention is needed to prompt ChatGPT to expand this node and obtain a more in-depth knowledge structure. For example, SEO is a knowledge node with many depths and may need to be further expanded.

2. The keywords listed by ChatGPT for knowledge points may not be clear enough and have multiple interpretations. In this case, manual supplementation is needed to make the keyword more specific. For example, the keyword "object-oriented" is too broad. If it's about Java object-oriented, changing it to "Java object-oriented" would be more specific.

3. ChatGPT's understanding of knowledge may be incorrect. Therefore, this part needs to be manually corrected to ensure the accuracy of knowledge. Readers can also confirm through the network data list that will be provided below.

Currently, several IT-related knowledge points have been automatically expanded by the program.
