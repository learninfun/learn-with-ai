Composite refers to an object or structure made up of multiple parts or elements that together make a complete whole. In computer science, a composite data type is a data type that is composed of one or more simpler data types. 

An example of composite can be a basketball team, where the team is made up of players, coaches, and staff. Each component of the team contributes to the success of the whole organization. In programming, a composite data type can be an array or a struct. An array is composed of multiple elements of the same data type, while a struct is a composite data type that groups together variables of different data types under a single name. 

Overall, the concept of composite highlights the idea of creating a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts, by combining multiple elements or objects in a meaningful manner.

1. Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to treat a group of objects in the same way as a single object. 

2. The pattern organizes objects into tree-like structures, where nodes represent individual objects, and branches represent composite objects. 

3. Clients can interact with the composite object and its individual components using a common interface, making it easy to add, remove or manipulate the objects in the tree structure. 

4. The composite pattern enhances code reuse and simplifies complex hierarchical structures by providing a unified interface for both individual and composite objects. 

5. The pattern supports recursive composition where a composite object can contain other composite objects, allowing it to represent an entire hierarchy of objects. 

6. The composite pattern should be used when dealing with objects that form a part-whole hierarchy, where individual and composite objects are treated interchangeably. 

7. Examples of the composite pattern can be found in GUI objects, file systems, and organization charts where groups of objects are treated as a single unit. 

8. The pattern differs from the decorator pattern, which focuses on adding new functionality to an object, while the composite pattern focuses on organizing objects into a hierarchical structure. 

9. Implementing the composite pattern requires creating an abstract Component class that defines the common interface for all objects in the hierarchy, as well as the Leaf and Composite classes that implement the Component interface.

1. What is the definition of a composite number?
Answer: A composite number is a positive integer greater than one that has multiple factors other than one and itself.

2. Is the number 21 a composite number?
Answer: Yes, 21 is a composite number since it has factors other than one and itself, such as 3 and 7.

3. What is the smallest composite number that is not a prime number?
Answer: The smallest composite number that is not a prime number is 4.

4. How many factors does the number 20 have?
Answer: The number 20 has six factors, which are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20.

5. Can a composite number be a perfect square?
Answer: Yes, a composite number can be a perfect square if it has multiple factors that are the same. For example, 16 is a composite number and a perfect square since it can be expressed as 4 x 4.
