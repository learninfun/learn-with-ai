Flyweight is a software design pattern in which objects are shared to reduce memory usage. It is used to reduce the number of objects created by reusing similar objects available in the system. This design pattern is used when we have a large number of objects of a similar type, and creating new objects for each instance can lead to huge memory consumption. 

For example, consider a game that requires a large number of trees. In this case, creating individual tree objects for each instance can consume a lot of memory. Instead, the Flyweight pattern suggests creating a single shared object that represents the common state of all the trees. Each individual tree object will then just reference this shared object and customize its state as needed (such as location, size, or color) without duplicating the common state. This can significantly reduce memory usage and speed up the game.

List the key points of Flyweight
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. Flyweight pattern is a structural design pattern.
2. It is used to optimize code that involves a large number of small and lightweight objects.
3. The pattern achieves optimization by sharing common data between multiple objects instead of creating separate copies of it.
4. The common data is maintained in a centralized data structure called the flyweight factory.
5. Flyweight pattern is particularly useful when the application has a large number of identical objects that consume a lot of memory.
6. It separates the intrinsic state (attributes that are common to all objects) from the extrinsic state (attributes that differ between objects).
7. The pattern allows for flexible representation of objects, as extrinsic state can be easily assigned or modified when needed.
8. In Java, the Flyweight pattern is implemented using interfaces, abstract classes or inheritance.
9. The pattern can be combined with other design patterns such as singleton and factory method.
10. Flyweight pattern can contribute to improved performance and reduced memory consumption, but may also introduce complexity to the code.   

## Review

Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about Flyweight
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. What is the main purpose of the Flyweight pattern?
Answer: The Flyweight pattern is used to improve the performance and resource utilization of an application by sharing a common set of objects that are used frequently.

2. How is the Flyweight pattern different from the Singleton pattern?
Answer: The Flyweight pattern is used to share a common set of objects that are used frequently, whereas the Singleton pattern is used to ensure that only one instance of a class is created.

3. What are the two types of objects in the Flyweight pattern?
Answer: The Flyweight pattern consists of intrinsic and extrinsic objects. Intrinsic objects are shared among multiple clients and have immutable properties, while extrinsic objects are unique to each client and have mutable properties.

4. What is the UML diagram for the Flyweight pattern?
Answer: The UML diagram for the Flyweight pattern consists of a Flyweight interface, ConcreteFlyweight class, FlyweightFactory class, and Client class.

5. What are the advantages of using the Flyweight pattern?
Answer: The advantages of using the Flyweight pattern include reduced memory consumption, improved performance, and simplified code maintenance. Additionally, it allows developers to reuse objects more efficiently and minimize the creation of unnecessary objects.

As an AI language model, I do not have access to the internet and cannot browse webpages. However, here is the relevant information about Flyweight:

Flyweight is a design pattern in software development used to minimize the memory usage and improve performance of an application by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. It achieves this by segregating an object's state into intrinsic and extrinsic states. Intrinsic state is the part of the object that can be shared across multiple instances, while extrinsic state is unique to each instance.

By using the Flyweight pattern, an application can greatly reduce its memory footprint and improve performance, particularly in situations where there are many instances of a particular object. This can be particularly useful in environments where memory and processing power are limited, such as in embedded systems or mobile devices.

There are several examples of Flyweight pattern usage, including in the design of graphical user interfaces, gaming engines, and database applications. The Flyweight pattern is particularly useful when an application involves a large number of similar objects, such as graphic elements (e.g. icons), database records, or game characters.

Overall, the Flyweight pattern is a powerful technique for optimizing software performance, reducing memory usage, and improving scalability. It can be a valuable addition to any developer's toolkit, particularly in situations where resources are limited.
