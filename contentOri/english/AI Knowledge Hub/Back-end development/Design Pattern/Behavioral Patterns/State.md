State refers to the condition of someone or something at a particular time or in a particular situation. It can also refer to a political entity, such as a nation or a territory within a nation.

For example, an individual's state of health could be described as good or poor depending on their current physical and mental conditions. A company's state of profitability can be described as strong or weak depending on its financial performance. A country's state government refers to the administrative body that governs a particular state within a nation, such as California or Texas in the United States.
