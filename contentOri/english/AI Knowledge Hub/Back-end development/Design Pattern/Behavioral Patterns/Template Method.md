Template Method is a design pattern that defines the basic steps of an algorithm, allowing subclasses to override specific steps without changing the overall algorithm structure.

The Template Method pattern consists of a base class that defines the overall algorithm structure through a series of abstract methods or concrete base methods. These methods can then be overridden by subclasses to provide specific implementations without affecting the overall algorithm.

For example, consider a class called "Pizza" that represents a pizza order. The template method for making a pizza might be as follows:

1. Prepare dough
2. Add sauce
3. Add cheese
4. Add toppings
5. Bake

The "prepare dough", "add sauce", "add cheese", and "bake" methods could be implemented in the base Pizza class, while "add toppings" could be abstract or even implemented as a default method that takes no action. Subclasses of Pizza such as "PepperoniPizza" and "VegetarianPizza" can then override the "add toppings" method to implement their specific toppings, without affecting the overall algorithm for making a pizza.

List the key points of Template Method
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that allows defining a skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and letting subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

2. Template method helps to eliminate repetitive code in related classes and promotes code reuse.

3. The pattern consists of two key components: an abstract base class and one or more concrete subclasses.

4. The base class contains a template method that defines the high-level algorithm, and one or more abstract methods (known as "hooks") that allow the subclasses to provide their own implementation for specific steps.

5. The concrete subclasses inherit from the base class and override the abstract methods to provide their own implementation for specific steps.

6. The template method guarantees the integrity of the algorithm by enforcing the order of execution for each step and preventing subclasses from changing the method signature.

7. Template method is commonly used in resource management, concurrency control, and stream processing applications.

8. Template method can make a code base more flexible, extensible and easier to maintain. 

9. However, its overuse can lead to complex class hierarchies and code duplication.   

## Review

{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}




1. What is the Template Method design pattern?
Answer: The Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, while allowing subclasses to override some steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

2. What problem does the Template Method pattern solve?
Answer: The Template Method pattern solves the problem of code duplication and the need for many similar algorithms with only small differences between each one.

3. What are the main components of the Template Method design pattern?
Answer: The main components of the Template Method pattern are the abstract base class (or template class), the concrete classes that implement the specific steps of the algorithm, and the hooks (or template methods) that allow subclasses to modify some parts of the algorithm.

4. How does the Template Method pattern differ from the Strategy pattern?
Answer: The Template Method pattern focuses on defining a fixed algorithm structure with optional hooks for customization, while the Strategy pattern defines interchangeable algorithms that can be selected and applied at runtime.

5. What are some real-world examples of the Template Method pattern?
Answer: Some examples of the Template Method pattern in real-world applications include compilers (with parsing and code generation stages), text editors (with different document types and file formats), and computer games (with different levels, enemies, and gameplay mechanics).
