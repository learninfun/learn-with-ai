The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is a string-matching algorithm that is used to find a pattern within a larger text string. It works by pre-computing a prefix function of the pattern, which is used to skip comparisons that are guaranteed to fail. This makes the algorithm more efficient than simple approaches such as brute force.

To use the KMP algorithm, we first construct a prefix function for the pattern string. This function maps each position in the pattern to the length of the longest proper prefix that is also a suffix of the substring up to that position.

For example, consider the pattern string "ABABCABAB". The prefix function for this string is as follows:

    Prefix function values for "ABABCABAB":
    A B A B C A B A B
    0 0 1 2 0 1 2 3 4

Using this prefix function, we can search for the pattern within a larger text string. We start by comparing the first character of the pattern to the first character of the text. If they match, we move on to compare the second character of the pattern to the second character of the text, and so on.

If at any point the characters do not match, we can use the prefix function to skip ahead in the pattern. Specifically, we look up the prefix value for the position in the pattern that we've reached, and move the pattern forward by that amount. We then continue the comparison from that new position.

For example, suppose we want to find the pattern "ABABCABAB" within the text string "ABABDABABCABABEF". We start by comparing the first character of the pattern ("A") to the first character of the text ("A"), and they match. We then compare the second characters ("B" and "B"), which also match. We continue this way until we get to the seventh character in the pattern ("A"), which does not match the seventh character in the text ("C").

At this point, we use the prefix function to determine how much to shift the pattern forward. The prefix value for position 6 in the pattern is 2, so we shift the pattern forward by 5 characters (the length of "ABABC"), and continue the comparison from there.

We repeat this process until we either find the pattern or reach the end of the text. In this case, we find the pattern starting at position 6 in the text.

While the KMP algorithm may seem complicated at first, it offers significant performance benefits in terms of time complexity. Specifically, it has a worst-case time complexity of O(m+n), where m is the length of the pattern and n is the length of the text. This makes it a useful tool in many applications, such as text editors and search engines.

1. A string matching algorithm that uses pre-processing to limit the number of character comparisons required.

2. The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm avoids starting again from the beginning of the search pattern when a match fails.

3. The algorithm uses information derived from previous matches to determine a new starting position for the search pattern.

4. The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm is based on the observation that, in a failed match, we can backtrack the search pattern to a position where some characters match the beginning of the pattern.

5. The algorithm constructs a table of partial match values for the search pattern, which is used to determine the new starting position.

6. The time complexity of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm is O(n+m), where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the search pattern.

## Review
{{< ask_chatgpt >}}
Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1) What is the time complexity of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm?
Answer: The time complexity of the KMP algorithm is O(n).

2) How does the KMP algorithm improve on the brute-force algorithm for string matching?
Answer: The KMP algorithm improves on the brute-force algorithm by using the information derived from the matches so far to avoid recomparing overlapping substrings.

3) What are the two main steps of the KMP algorithm?
Answer: The two main steps of the KMP algorithm are the pre-processing step, which constructs the partial match table, and the matching step, which uses the table to find all occurrences of the pattern within the text.

4) How does the KMP algorithm handle the case where there are multiple occurrences of the pattern within the text?
Answer: The KMP algorithm uses the partial match table to keep track of where the previous matches occurred, and continues the search from the end of the previous match to find all occurrences of the pattern.

5) What is the partial match table, and how is it constructed?
Answer: The partial match table is a data structure used by the KMP algorithm to store information about the pattern that can be used to avoid unnecessary comparisons during string matching. It is constructed by analyzing the pattern itself and finding the longest proper prefix that is also a suffix of each prefix of the pattern.
