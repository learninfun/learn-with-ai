Worst-case time complexity refers to the maximum amount of time that an algorithm can take to solve a particular problem. In other words, it is the upper bound on the time required to execute an algorithm for the worst possible input data set. 

For instance, consider the linear search algorithm that is used to find an element in an unsorted list of n elements. The worst-case time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), which means that the algorithm will take the maximum amount of time equal to n to find the element if it is present at the end of the list or not present at all. 

Suppose we have a list of n elements and are searching for an element that is not present in the list or is present at the end of the list. In either case, the algorithm will need to search through all the n elements before returning with a result. Hence, the worst-case time complexity of the linear search algorithm is O(n). 

Worst-case time complexity helps us to estimate the performance of an algorithm in terms of processing time and memory requirements. It is important to consider worst-case time complexity when designing and implementing algorithms for large data sets.

1. Worst-case time complexity is a measure of the maximum amount of time that an algorithm can take to complete, based on the input size.

2. It is determined by analyzing the algorithm's performance under the worst-case scenario, where the input data leads to the longest possible computational time.

3. The worst-case time complexity is expressed as a function of the input size, typically denoted by n.

4. Common worst-case time complexity notations include O(1), O(n), O(log n), O(n^2) and O(2^n), among others.

5. Algorithms with lower worst-case time complexity are generally more efficient than those with higher complexity.

6. Specific algorithms may have different worst-case time complexities depending on the input data, which makes careful analysis of an algorithm's performance crucial.

7. Achieving a lower worst-case time complexity often requires trade-offs between speed and memory usage or other resources.

8. Improvements in algorithms and data structures can lead to better worst-case time complexity for certain problems.
