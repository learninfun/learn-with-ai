Modular exponentiation is a mathematical operation that involves computing the remainder when a number is raised to a power and divided by a modulus. It is often used in cryptography and computer science to compute large values efficiently.

The formula for modular exponentiation is:

a^b mod n

where a is the base, b is the exponent, and n is the modulus.

For example, let's calculate 3^7 mod 5.

To do this, we first calculate 3^7:

3^7 = 2187

Then, we find the remainder when 2187 is divided by 5:

2187 mod 5 = 2

Therefore, 3^7 mod 5 = 2.

1. Modular exponentiation involves finding the remainder when a large number is raised to a power and divided by a smaller number.

2. It is commonly used in cryptography, as it allows for efficient encryption and decryption of data.

3. The basic algorithm for modular exponentiation involves iteratively multiplying the base by itself and reducing the result modulo the modulus, until the exponent is fully processed.

4. More efficient methods of modular exponentiation include binary exponentiation and Montgomery multiplication.

5. Binary exponentiation involves treating the exponent as a binary number and squaring the base multiple times until the desired exponent is reached.

6. Montgomery multiplication uses a special representation of the modulus that allows for faster modular arithmetic operations.

7. Modular exponentiation can also be used for various other applications, such as computing discrete logarithms and generating pseudo-random numbers.
