Primality Testing is a process to determine if a given number is a prime number or not. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

One example of a primality testing method is the trial division method. In this method, we divide the number to be tested by all integers from 2 to the square root of that number. If any divisor other than 1 and itself is found, then the number is composite, otherwise, it is prime.

For example, let's test the number 23 for primality using the trial division method. The square root of 23 is approximately 4.8. We divide 23 by all integers from 2 to 4. We find that there is no divisor other than 1 and 23. Therefore, 23 is a prime number.

1. What is the most commonly used method for primality testing?
Answer: The most commonly used method for primality testing is the Miller-Rabin algorithm.

2. How does the Fermat primality test work?
Answer: The Fermat primality test involves testing whether a given number n is prime by checking if a^(n-1) â‰¡ 1 (mod n) where a is any integer between 1 and n-1.

3. What is the complexity of the Miller-Rabin primality test?
Answer: The complexity of the Miller-Rabin primality test is O(k log^3 n) where k is the number of iterations required for a given accuracy.

4. Can the Miller-Rabin primality test produce false positives?
Answer: Yes, the Miller-Rabin primality test can produce false positives for composite numbers that behave like primes under the chosen bases used in the test.

5. What is the AKS algorithm for primality testing?
Answer: The AKS algorithm for primality testing is a deterministic algorithm that determines whether a given number n is prime or composite in polynomial time, specifically O(log^6 n).
