Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array of elements by partitioning the array into two sub-arrays based on a "pivot" element, and recursively sorting the sub-arrays. 

Here's an example of how a Quick Sort algorithm would work on an array of numbers:

1. Choose a pivot value from the array. For simplicity, let's choose the first element as the pivot, so pivot = 5.
2. Partition the array into two sub-arrays: one with elements less than the pivot, and one with elements greater than the pivot. In this case, we end up with [3, 2, 4] and [9, 7, 1, 6, 8], respectively.
3. Recursively sort the sub-arrays using the same Quick Sort algorithm. For the sub-array with elements less than the pivot, we choose 3 as the pivot, partition the array into [2] and [4], and recurse on each sub-array until we reach arrays of length 1 or 0. Since each of these sub-arrays is already sorted, we can combine them back into [2, 3, 4].
4. We repeat the above process for the sub-array with elements greater than the pivot: choose 9 as the pivot, partition into [7, 1, 6, 8] and [ ], recurse on the first sub-array to get [1, 6, 7, 8], and combine with the empty sub-array to get [1, 6, 7, 8, 9].
5. Finally, we combine the sorted sub-arrays from step 3 and step 4 to get the fully sorted array: [2, 3, 4, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9].   

## Keypoint

List the key points of Quick Sort
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. Quick sort is a popular sorting algorithm utilized to sort arrays.

2. It is a divide and conquer algorithm.

3. It sorts arrays by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the original array around the pivot element.

4. After partitioning, the algorithm recursively sorts the partitioned sub-arrays.

5. The sub-arrays are sorted in such a way that every element on the left side of the pivot is less than or equal to the pivot and every element on the right side of the pivot is greater than or equal to it.

6. Quick sort has an average case time complexity of O(n log n).

7. Its worst case time complexity is O(n^2).

8. It's a preferred sorting algorithm amongst researchers, engineers, and data scientists due to its efficiency.

9. Two significant factors affecting its overall performance include pivot selection and partitioning method.

10. Because quick sort requires recursive function calls, it can suffer from stack overflow, particularly with large data sets.   

## Review

Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about Quick Sort
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. What is the time complexity of Quick Sort algorithm in the worst case? 
Answer: The worst-case time complexity of Quick Sort algorithm is O(n^2).

2. What is the key concept behind Quick Sort algorithm? 
Answer: The key concept behind Quick Sort algorithm is the partitioning of the input array around a pivot element.

3. What is an optimal choice of pivot element in Quick Sort algorithm? 
Answer: An optimal choice of pivot element in Quick Sort algorithm is the median of the input array.

4. How is stability defined in sorting algorithms, and is Quick Sort stable? 
Answer: Stability in sorting algorithms means that two equal elements in the input array retain their relative ordering in the output array. Quick Sort is not stable.

5. What is the role of recursion in Quick Sort algorithm? 
Answer: Recursion plays a central role in Quick Sort algorithm, as the partitioning process is applied recursively on the two sub-arrays formed by partitioning the input array.
