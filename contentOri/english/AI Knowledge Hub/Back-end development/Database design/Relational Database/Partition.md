Partition is a method for dividing a set into non-overlapping subsets or groups. Each subset in a partition has one or more common elements, and the union of all subsets in the partition is equal to the original set.

For example, consider the set of integers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. We can partition this set into two subsets as follows:

Subset 1: {1, 2, 3, 4}

Subset 2: {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The subsets are non-overlapping and their union is equal to the original set. Another way to partition this set could be:

Subset 1: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}

Subset 2: {2, 4, 6, 8}

Again, the subsets are non-overlapping and their union is equal to the original set.
