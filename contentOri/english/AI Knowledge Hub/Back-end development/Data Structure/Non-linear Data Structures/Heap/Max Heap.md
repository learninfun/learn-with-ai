Max Heap is a data structure which is a complete binary tree where the value of each node is greater than or equal to its children. In other words, the root node has the maximum value in the heap. For example, let's say we have a max heap of the following values:

          15
        /    \
      10     13
     /  \   /  \
    9   8  11  7
    
In this case, the root node has the maximum value of 15, and the value of any node is greater than or equal to its children. The left child of 15 is 10, which is smaller than 15 but greater than its child nodes. Similarly, the right child of 15 is 13, which is also smaller than 15 but greater than its child nodes. This pattern continues throughout the heap. 

Max Heap is used in many applications, such as priority queues, heapsort, and graph algorithms.   

## Keypoint

List the key points of Max Heap
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. A Max Heap is a type of binary tree where each parent node is greater than or equal to its child nodes.
2. The highest priority element is always at the top of the heap, which is the root node.
3. The left child of a node is always smaller than its right child.
4. The height of a max heap is always logarithmic with respect to the number of nodes in the tree.
5. A max heap can be efficiently implemented using an array.
6. The time complexity for inserting a new element in a max heap is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the heap.
7. Similarly, the time complexity for deleting the root node (highest priority) is also O(log n).
8. Max heaps are used in many applications, including sorting algorithms like heap sort and priority queues.   

## Review

Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about Max Heap
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. What is a Max Heap?
Answer: A Max Heap is a binary tree where the parent node is larger than its child nodes.

2. How is a Max Heap represented in an array?
Answer: In an array representation of a Max Heap, each node is assigned an index, and the parent node is assigned the index value (i-1)/2, the left child node is assigned the index value 2i+1, and the right child node is assigned the index value 2i+2.

3. What is the time complexity of inserting a new element in a Max Heap?
Answer: The time complexity of inserting a new element in a Max Heap is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the heap.

4. How is the maximum element extracted from a Max Heap?
Answer: To extract the maximum element from a Max Heap, the root node (maximum element) is swapped with the last node in the heap. The last node is then removed, and the heap is re-arranged to maintain the Max Heap property.

5. What is the time complexity of extracting the maximum element from a Max Heap?
Answer: The time complexity of extracting the maximum element from a Max Heap is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the heap.
