Bellman-Ford Algorithm is an algorithm used for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph, from a source vertex to all other vertices. The algorithm computes the distance of the shortest path in a dynamic fashion, i.e. based on the previous computed distance, it computes the next shortest distance until it reaches the correct distance for all vertices. The algorithm can handle both positive and negative weights, but it cannot handle negative weight cycles.

Here are the steps for the Bellman-Ford Algorithm:

1. Initialize the distance of all vertices from the source vertex to infinity, except the source vertex, which is zero.
2. For each vertex, update the distance if a smaller path exists through other vertices.
3. Repeat step 2 V-1 times (where V is the number of vertices).
4. Check for negative weight cycles, and if any are found, report and exit.

Example:

Let's consider the following graph:

Starting from vertex 0, we can use Bellman-Ford Algorithm to compute the shortest path to all other vertices:

1. Initialize the distance of all vertices to infinity, except the source vertex, which is 0: 

| Vertex | Dist |
|--------|------|
|   0    |   0  |
|   1    |  Inf |
|   2    |  Inf |
|   3    |  Inf |
|   4    |  Inf |

2. Update distances for all vertices: 

| Vertex |      Dist     |
|--------|---------------|
|   0    |       0       |
|   1    |       10      |
|   2    |       5       |
|   3    |       15      |
|   4    |       20      |

3. Repeat step 2 V-1 times, which in this case is 4 times.
4. Final distance table: 

| Vertex |      Dist     |
|--------|---------------|
|   0    |       0       |
|   1    |       10      |
|   2    |       5       |
|   3    |       15      |
|   4    |       20      |

Thus, the shortest path from vertex 0 to all other vertices are:

- 0 to 0: 0
- 0 to 1: 0 -> 2 -> 1, distance = 5 + 5 = 10
- 0 to 2: 0 -> 2, distance = 5
- 0 to 3: 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3, distance = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15
- 0 to 4: 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4, distance = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20

1. Bellman-Ford Algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a starting vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
2. It is a dynamic programming algorithm that iteratively computes the shortest path distances by relaxing the edges of the graph in a topological order.
3. It can handle negative edge weights, which is not possible with Dijkstra's Algorithm.
4. If the graph contains a negative cycle, then Bellman-Ford Algorithm can detect it, and indicate that there is no shortest path.
5. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(V*E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
6. The algorithm returns a list of shortest path distances from the starting vertex to all other vertices in the graph.   

## Review
{{< ask_chatgpt >}}
Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about Bellman-Ford Algorithm
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. What is the Bellman-Ford algorithm used for?
Answer: The algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.

2. What is the time complexity of the Bellman-Ford algorithm?
Answer: The time complexity of the algorithm is O(EV), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices in the graph.

3. How does the Bellman-Ford algorithm handle negative weight edges?
Answer: The algorithm can detect the presence of negative weight cycles in a graph and reports an error in case it is present. If there is no negative cycle, then it can report the shortest path even for graphs with negative-weight edges.

4. How does the Bellman-Ford algorithm differ from Dijkstra's algorithm?
Answer: Dijkstra's algorithm is only applicable to graphs without negative weight edges, while Bellman-Ford algorithm can handle negative weights. Also, Dijkstra's algorithm uses a priority queue to determine the minimum distance vertex to visit next, while Bellman-Ford algorithm simply relaxes all edges in each iteration.

5. What is the relaxation process in the Bellman-Ford algorithm?
Answer: The relaxation process is essentially the algorithm's method of updating the distance of each vertex from the source vertex. It is achieved by checking if the distance of a vertex can be improved by relaxing an edge that is connected to it. If the distance can be improved, then the updated distance is recorded.
