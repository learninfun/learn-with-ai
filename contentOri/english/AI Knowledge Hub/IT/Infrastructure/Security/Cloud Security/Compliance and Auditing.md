{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



Compliance refers to the act of following rules, regulations, policies, and laws that govern an organization's operations. Compliance ensures that a company adheres to the ethical and legal standards set by financial institutions, regulatory bodies and governments.

Auditing, on the other hand, is the examination and verification of a company's financial and operational records to ensure they are accurate and conform to regulatory guidelines.

An example of compliance and auditing in practice would be an external auditor hired by a company to perform a financial audit. This auditor will examine the company's financial statements, internal controls, and other accounting documents to ensure they align with the relevant accounting standards and regulatory requirements. They will then provide a report detailing their findings and recommendations for adjustments if any non-compliance is found. This process ensures that the company is operating in agreement with the necessary rules and regulations.
