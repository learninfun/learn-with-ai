A Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a buffer area between two conflicting countries or factions, where military personnel and weapons are prohibited. This zone is intended to reduce the risk of armed conflict and create a safe separation between two opposing sides.

An example of a Demilitarized Zone is the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which is a strip of land that runs about 250 kilometers (155 miles) across the Korean peninsula, dividing North Korea from South Korea. This DMZ is one of the most heavily fortified borders in the world, with barbed wire fences, guard towers, and landmines. No military personnel are allowed within 2 km of either side of the border, and both sides are only allowed limited patrols within the DMZ. The Korean DMZ was created in 1953, after the Korean War ended in stalemate, as a means of preventing further conflict between the two countries.
