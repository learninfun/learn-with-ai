Explain Pilot Light and give an example
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}

A pilot light is a small flame that is continuously burning on a gas appliance to ignite the main burner when needed. The pilot light is usually a blue flame that is ignited by either an electronic ignition system or a standing pilot light.

Example: A gas water heater has a pilot light that continuously burns to heat the water. When hot water is needed, the pilot light ignites the gas burner, which heats the water in the tank. The pilot light also ensures that the burner is turned off when the hot water supply is not needed, saving energy and preventing gas leaks.
