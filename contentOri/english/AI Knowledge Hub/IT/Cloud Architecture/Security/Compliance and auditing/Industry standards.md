This standard specifies requirements for quality management systems, such as documentation, procedures, training, and continuous improvement. This standard aims to improve customer satisfaction, reduce waste, and increase efficiency across industries. By adhering to these standards, companies can demonstrate their commitment to quality products and services, competitiveness, and regulatory compliance.
