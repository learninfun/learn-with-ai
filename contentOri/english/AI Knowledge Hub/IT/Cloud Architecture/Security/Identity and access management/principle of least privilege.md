Principle of least privilege is a security best practice that restricts access rights and permissions to only the essential resources required to perform a task or job function. This practice helps to minimize a system's attack surface and mitigate risk of security breaches or unauthorized access.

For example, a user account with administrative access should only be utilized when performing administrative tasks. If the user only needs to perform basic tasks, such as accessing files, editing documents or emails, then they should only have user-level access rights to those resources. By limiting user access rights to only what they need to complete their job function, the principle of least privilege improves security and reduces the potential for cyberattacks or insider threats.   

## Keypoint

List the key points of principle of least privilege
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}

1. Only grant access to the resources that are necessary to perform a job or task.
2. Limit the scope of access to the minimum level required to complete the task.
3. Ensure that users have the least possible rights and permissions necessary to do their work.
4. Use strong authentication and access controls to prevent unauthorized access.
5. Regularly review and audit access controls to ensure they are still appropriate for the current environment.
6. Limit the number of users with administrative privileges.
7. Use role-based access controls that limit the tasks and resources a user can access based on their job duties or responsibilities.   

## Review

Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about principle of least privilege
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}

1. What is the principle of least privilege?
Answer: The principle of least privilege is a security principle that dictates that a user should only be granted the minimum level of access required to perform their job functions.

2. How does the principle of least privilege enhance security?
Answer: By limiting the user's access to only what is necessary to perform their job, the potential for unauthorized access and misuse of resources is minimized, thus enhancing security.

3. What are some examples of implementing the principle of least privilege in real-world scenarios?
Answer: Examples include limiting administrative privileges to only a select group of users, restricting network access to only authorized devices, and enforcing strong password policies.

4. What potential challenges might arise when implementing the principle of least privilege?
Answer: Some challenges may include determining exactly what level of access is necessary for each user, managing access controls for a large number of users, and keeping access controls up to date.

5. How does the principle of least privilege relate to the concept of defense-in-depth?
Answer: The principle of least privilege is one layer of a comprehensive defense-in-depth strategy, which includes multiple layers of security controls to protect against various types of threats.
