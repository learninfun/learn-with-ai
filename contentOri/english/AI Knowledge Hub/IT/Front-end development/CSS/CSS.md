CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to define the look and formatting of a website. CSS is responsible for setting the size, color, font, and style of website elements such as text, images, and video. 

Here's an example of how CSS works to change the look of an HTML element:

In HTML, you might have a paragraph element that looks like this:

<p>Hello, World!</p>

If you want to make the text "Hello, World!" appear in bold, you can use CSS. Here's how:

p {
 font-weight: bold;
}

This CSS code targets the paragraph element (indicated by the "p" selector) and sets the font-weight property to bold. This means that all text within the paragraph element will now appear in a bold font.

Overall, CSS allows designers and developers to create visually engaging and aesthetically pleasing websites that are easy to navigate and use.

1. What is the difference between padding and margin in CSS?
Answer: Padding is the space between the content and the border of an element, while margin is the space outside the border of an element.

2. How can you center an element horizontally and vertically using CSS?
Answer: You can use the "display" property with the "flex" value for the parent element, along with "justify-content" and "align-items" properties set to "center".

3. What is the difference between "px", "em" and "rem" units in CSS?
Answer: "px" is a fixed unit of measurement, while "em" and "rem" are relative units. "em" is relative to the font-size of the parent element, while "rem" is relative to the font-size of the root element.

4. How can you make an element responsive using CSS?
Answer: You can use media queries to apply different styles to an element based on the screen size of the device. You can also use percentage or relative units for sizing and positioning.

5. How can you create a simple animation in CSS?
Answer: You can use the "@keyframes" rule to define the animation and the "animation" property to apply it to an element. For example, "@keyframes slidein { from { transform: translateX(-100%); } to { transform: translateX(0); } }" and "animation: slidein 1s ease-in-out;".
