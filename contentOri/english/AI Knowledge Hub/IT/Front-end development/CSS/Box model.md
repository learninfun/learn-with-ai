The Box Model is a concept used in web design and development that refers to the design and layout of HTML pages. It defines the box-like structure that each element on a web page is enclosed in, from the content inside to the surrounding margin, padding, and border.

The Box Model consists of four main properties:

1. Content: The actual content of an HTML element, such as text or images.

2. Padding: The space between the content and the element's border.

3. Border: The boundary that surrounds an HTML element.

4. Margin: The space between the element's border and the surrounding elements.

For example, suppose you have a div element on your web page, and you want to apply a background color to it. The box model structure for this element would look like this:

```
<div style="border: 2px solid black; padding: 10px; margin: 20px; background-color: #FFF;">
  This is some content inside a div box.
</div>
```

In this example, the content inside the div element is "This is some content inside a div box." The padding is set to 10 pixels, the border is set to 2 pixels wide and solid black, and the margin is set to 20 pixels. The background color is set to white (#FFF). All of these properties combine to define the box-like structure of the div element.
