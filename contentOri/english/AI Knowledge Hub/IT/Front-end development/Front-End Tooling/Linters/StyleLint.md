Explain StyleLint and give an example
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



StyleLint is a modern linter for CSS syntax and formatting that can help identify and report on common errors and inconsistencies in CSS code. 

For example, StyleLint can flag issues such as missing or invalid vendor prefixes, enforcing the usage of a specific syntax, enforcing a certain indentation style or valid class or id names.

Here's an example configuration object that enables StyleLint in a project:

```
{
  "extends": "stylelint-config-standard",
  "rules": {
    "indentation": 2,
    "string-quotes": "double",
    "color-hex-case": "lower",
    "declaration-colon-space-after": "always",
    "selector-descendant-combinator-no-non-space": true,
    "selector-pseudo-element-colon-notation": "double",
    "unit-case": "lower",
    "value-keyword-case": "lower"
  }
}
```

This configuration sets up some basic rules that enforce indentation of 2 spaces, double quotes around strings, lowercase hex colors, whitespace after colons in declarations, prevention of non-space characters after the descendant selector,  double colons for pseudo-elements, lowercase unit values and value keywords.
