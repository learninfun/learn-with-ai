{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



Keyboard navigation is a method of navigating through different elements or sections of a website using only keyboard keys or shortcuts. This feature is particularly useful for people with disabilities or those who prefer to use the keyboard instead of a mouse.

An example of keyboard navigation is using the "tab" key to move between different clickable elements on a webpage, such as links or buttons. Once a desired element is highlighted, the user can press the "enter" or "space" key to activate it.

Another example is using the arrow keys to scroll up and down a webpage, or using keyboard shortcuts such as "Ctrl + F" to search for specific content on the page. Users can also use the keyboard to access menus and submenus, by pressing the "alt" key and corresponding letter or number keys.

Overall, keyboard navigation helps to improve the accessibility and usability of a website, making it easier for users to navigate and interact with its content.
