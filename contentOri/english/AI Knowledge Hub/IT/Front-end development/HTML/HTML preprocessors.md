HTML preprocessors are tools that help in generating HTML templates dynamically. These tools work on top of HTML and enhance its functionality by adding additional features like variables, loops, and conditionals. They help in DRY coding, which means "Don't Repeat Yourself." HTML preprocessors save time, and once the development is complete, they simplify the maintenance of the project.

Here is an example of an HTML preprocessor called "Pug." It is quite popular due to its concise and readable syntax.

In the traditional HTML, to create an unordered list, we would write the following code:

```HTML
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

But using Pug, we can write the same list in a more concise and readable way.

```pug
ul
  li Item 1
  li Item 2
  li Item 3
```

As you can see, in Pug, we use indentation instead of opening and closing tags.

Using Pug, developers can write templates in a more concise and readable way, and when the template has many variables, loops, and conditionals, the benefits of using Pug become evident.
