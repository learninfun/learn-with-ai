HTML templating engines are tools that simplify the process of creating HTML pages by using variables and dynamic data. These engines work by separating the HTML content from the data it represents, allowing for more efficient web development.

One popular example of an HTML templating engine is Handlebars. Handlebars is a JavaScript templating engine that allows developers to create reusable templates for HTML content. With Handlebars, developers can create a template with placeholders for dynamic data, and then use JavaScript to fill in the data at runtime.

Here's an example of a Handlebars template:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>{{title}}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>{{heading}}</h1>
    <p>{{content}}</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example, the `{{}}` placeholders represent dynamic data that can be filled in with JavaScript. For instance, if we had a JavaScript object with properties for `title`, `heading`, and `content`, we could use Handlebars to render the template with that data:

```javascript
var data = {
  title: "My Awesome Page",
  heading: "Welcome to my site",
  content: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
};

var template = Handlebars.compile(source);
var html = template(data);

document.body.innerHTML = html;
```

This would generate an HTML page with the appropriate data filled in, based on the Handlebars template. Other popular HTML templating engines include Mustache, EJS, and Pug.
