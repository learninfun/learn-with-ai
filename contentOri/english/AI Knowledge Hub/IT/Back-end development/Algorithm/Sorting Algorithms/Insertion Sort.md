Insertion sort is an algorithm in computer science used to sort an array or list of elements into ascending or descending order. It works by sorting one element at a time and placing them in their correct position.

The idea behind insertion sort is that for each element in the unsorted list, it is compared to the elements that are already sorted, and then placed in its correct position relative to them.

Here is how it works:

1. We start with an unsorted list of integers: [5, 3, 1, 8, 6, 9]

2. We take the first element and compare it to the second element. If the first element is greater than the second element, we swap them.

[5, 3, 1, 8, 6, 9] -> [3, 5, 1, 8, 6, 9]

3. We take the third element and compare it to the first two elements. We swap it with the second element if it is smaller, and swap it with the first element if it is smaller than both the first and the second element.

[3, 5, 1, 8, 6, 9] -> [1, 3, 5, 8, 6, 9]

4. We repeat this process for all the remaining elements in the array until the entire array is sorted.

[1, 3, 5, 8, 6, 9] -> [1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9]

5. The resulting sorted array is [1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9].

Insertion sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm for small arrays, but its performance deteriorates quickly for large arrays.

List the key points of Insertion Sort
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. Insertion Sort algorithm is a simple and intuitive algorithm used to sort arrays and lists of elements.

2. It works by comparing each item in an array with the items before it, and shifting those items over to make room for the new item if necessary.

3. The algorithm starts with the first two elements in the array and compares them, swapping them if necessary to make sure the first element comes before the second.

4. The algorithm then moves on to the next element in the array and repeats the process, comparing it with all the elements that come before it and shifting them over if necessary.

5. Once the array is sorted, the algorithm terminates.

6. Insertion Sort has an average-case time complexity of O(n^2), which make it less efficient than other sorting algorithms like QuickSort and MergeSort.

7. However, it has a low space complexity and is relatively easy to implement, making it a good choice for small lists or as an optimization in other algorithms.   

## Review

Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about Insertion Sort
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1) What is the time complexity of insertion sort?
Answer: The time complexity of insertion sort is O(n^2).

2) What is the basic idea behind insertion sort?
Answer: The basic idea behind insertion sort is to divide the input list into a sorted sublist and an unsorted sublist. Elements from the unsorted sublist are inserted into the sorted sublist in such a way that the sorted sublist remains sorted.

3) What is the worst case space complexity of insertion sort?
Answer: The worst case space complexity of insertion sort is O(1).

4) Can insertion sort be used to sort a linked list?
Answer: Yes, insertion sort can be used to sort a linked list as it uses a simple operation of inserting an element into a linked list.

5) What is the difference between stable and unstable sorting algorithms? Is insertion sort a stable or unstable sorting algorithm?
Answer: Stable sorting algorithms maintain the relative order of equal elements. Unstable sorting algorithms do not guarantee the relative order of equal elements. Insertion sort is a stable sorting algorithm.
