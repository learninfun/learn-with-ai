Topological sort is an algorithm that orders the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in such a way that for every directed edge (u,v), vertex u comes before vertex v in the ordering. It is used to show dependencies between tasks and to schedule tasks in the correct order.

The algorithm works by selecting a vertex with no incoming edges, adding it to the sorted list, and removing its outgoing edges. This process is repeated until all vertices have been added to the list.

For example, consider the following graph:

```
A -> B -> E
|         ^
v         |
+ -> C -> D
```

A valid topological sort for this graph would be A, C, B, D, E. Starting with A, we remove its outgoing edge to B. Since B now has no incoming edges, it is added to the sort. We then remove Bâ€™s outgoing edge to E. Moving on to C, we remove its outgoing edge to D. Finally, D has no incoming edges so it is added to the sort and E is added as the final vertex in the sort.

1. Topological sort is a technique for ordering the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

2. It provides a linear ordering of the vertices such that for every directed edge from vertex A to vertex B, vertex A comes before vertex B in the ordering.

3. The ordering obtained from topological sort is not unique, but all valid orderings satisfy the same constraints.

4. It can be used to solve a variety of problems such as scheduling tasks, determining dependencies, and finding a feasible order of events.

5. If a DAG contains a cycle, it is impossible to define a topological ordering because the cycle will prevent any vertex from being placed before another vertex in the ordering.

6. Topological sort can be implemented using either depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms.

7. The time complexity of topological sort is O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.   

## Review
{{< ask_chatgpt >}}
Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about Topological Sort
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. What is a Topological Sort?
Answer: Topological Sort is a linear ordering algorithm that arranges vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in such a way that each vertex appears before all its successors.

2. What is the time complexity of Topological Sort?
Answer: The time complexity of Topological Sort is O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

3. Can a graph with cycles be topologically sorted?
Answer: No, a graph with cycles cannot be topologically sorted as the algorithm requires the input graph to be a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

4. What is the significance of Topological Sort in computer science?
Answer: Topological Sort is used in various computer science algorithms and applications, including scheduling processes, dependency management, resolving symbol dependencies, and circuit design.

5. What is the difference between Topological Sort and Depth First Search (DFS)?
Answer: DFS is a traversal algorithm that visits all reachable vertices, while Topological Sort is a linear ordering algorithm that arranges vertices in a directed acyclic graph in a specific order. However, both algorithms use similar techniques for graph traversal, and Topological Sort can be implemented using a modified DFS algorithm.
