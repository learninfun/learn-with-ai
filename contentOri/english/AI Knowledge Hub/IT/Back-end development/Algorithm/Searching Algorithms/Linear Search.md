Linear search is a simple searching algorithm that sequentially checks every element in a list until the desired element is found or the end of the list is reached. 

Example: Suppose we have a list of numbers from 1 to 10 and we want to search for the number 7 in the list. We start at the first element and compare it with the desired element. If it’s not a match, we move on to the next element and continue the process until we find the element we’re looking for. In this case, we would start by checking the first element (1), then the second element (2), and so on until we reach the seventh element, which is the number 7 we were searching for. If the element is not found in the list, we eventually reach the end of the list and return with a “not found” message.

List the key points of Linear Search
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. Linear search is a searching algorithm that checks each element of an array in a sequential manner until the desired element is found.
2. It is a simple and easy-to-understand algorithm.
3. The time complexity of linear search is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. 
4. It is suitable for small arrays or unsorted arrays.
5. Linear search can be implemented with or without recursion.
6. Binary search is a faster alternative to linear search for larger arrays and sorted arrays.

Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about Linear Search
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. What is the worst-case time complexity of linear search algorithm?

Answer: The worst-case time complexity of linear search algorithm is O(n), where 'n' is the size of the array.

2. What is linear search algorithm?

Answer: Linear search algorithm is a simple search algorithm that sequentially searches for a target value in an array or list by checking each element one at a time until a match is found.

3. Can linear search algorithm be applied to sorted arrays?

Answer: Yes, linear search algorithm can be applied to sorted arrays, but it is not efficient. In sorted arrays, binary search algorithm is preferred.

4. Can linear search algorithm be applied to linked lists?

Answer: Yes, linear search algorithm can be applied to linked lists, but it requires a different approach as there is no concept of index in linked lists.

5. What are the advantages and limitations of linear search algorithm?

Answer: The advantages of linear search algorithm are that it is simple and easy to implement. The limitations of linear search algorithm are that it is inefficient for large sized arrays and does not take advantage of any pre-existing order in the array.
