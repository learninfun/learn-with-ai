Exponential Search is a searching algorithm that works on sorted arrays. It tries to find the range where the target element may lie, and then performs a binary search within that range to locate the element. 

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Set a minimum value (start) to 0 and a maximum value (end) to the length of the array minus 1
2. Check if the target value is equal to the first element of the array. If it is, return 0 as the index.
3. Set an exponent value (exp) to 1 and keep increasing it until the index of the element at the exponent position is greater than the target value or the end of the array is reached.
4. Once an exponent value that meets the criteria is found, perform a binary search within the range of the previous exponent and the current exponent to find the target value. 

Here's an example: 

Suppose we have a sorted array [2, 7, 13, 18, 22, 25, 32, 35, 40]. We want to search for the element 22 using the exponential search algorithm.

1. Start = 0, End = 8, Target = 22
2. Check if target = array[0] = 2, it's not.
3. The first exponent is 1, so we check array[1] = 7. As 7 < target, we continue to the next exponent.
4. The second exponent is 2, so we check array[2] = 13. As 13 < target, we continue to the next exponent.
5. The third exponent is 4, so we check array[4] = 22. As 22 = target, we perform a binary search within the range of previous exponent (2) and current exponent (4).
6. Binary search finds the target element at index 4.

In this case, exponential search took 3 iterations to find the range where the target element lies, and binary search took 2 iterations to locate the element. The total number of iterations is 5 in this case, which is less than the 9 iterations required for a traditional binary search.   

## Keypoint

List the key points of Exponential Search
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. Exponential search is a search algorithm used to find a specific element in a sorted, unbounded list or array.
2. It works by finding the range where the target element might be present and then performing a binary search in that range to find the exact location.
3. The range is expanded exponentially with each iteration until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached.
4. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n) in the worst case, where n is the size of the list or array.
5. Exponential search is efficient for searching large lists or arrays, especially when the target element is near the beginning of the list or array.   

## Review

Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about Exponential Search
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. What is the time complexity of Exponential Search? 
Answer: The time complexity of Exponential Search is O(log n).

2. How does Exponential Search differ from Binary Search in terms of its approach? 
Answer: Exponential Search uses a logarithmic approach where the search space is doubled each time, while Binary Search divides the search space in half.

3. What is the advantage of using Exponential Search over Binary Search? 
Answer: Exponential Search can be more efficient than Binary Search in scenarios where the size of the search space is unknown or unbounded.

4. Can Exponential Search be used to search for a value in an unordered list? 
Answer: No, Exponential Search requires the list to be sorted in ascending or descending order.

5. What happens if the target value is not found in the list during an Exponential Search? 
Answer: The algorithm will continue to double the range until it exceeds the length of the list, causing the search to fail and return a -1 value.
