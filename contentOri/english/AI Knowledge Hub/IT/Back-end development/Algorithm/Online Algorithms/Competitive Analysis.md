Competitive analysis is the process of analyzing and identifying the strengths and weaknesses of your company’s competitors in order to gain an advantage in the market. It is a crucial component of any business strategy as it helps businesses to stay ahead of the competition and make informed decisions about their products and services.

An example of competitive analysis is the analysis of the smartphone market. Companies such as Apple, Samsung, and Huawei are the major players in this market. In order to gain a competitive advantage, each company would analyze the strengths and weaknesses of their competitors. For instance, Samsung would analyze Apple’s marketing and customer loyalty, Huawei’s innovation strategy, and their pricing strategy. They would then use this information to make informed decisions about their own marketing, innovation, and pricing strategies in order to stay ahead of the competition. This would allow them to differentiate themselves from their competitors and offer unique value propositions to customers.
