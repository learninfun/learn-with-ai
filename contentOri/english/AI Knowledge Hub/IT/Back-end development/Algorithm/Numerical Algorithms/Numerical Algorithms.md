Numerical algorithms are a set of mathematical techniques used to solve problems that require numerical approximations or computations. They are used extensively in scientific, engineering, and financial applications where exact solutions to mathematical problems are impractical or impossible.

One example of a numerical algorithm is the Newton-Raphson method, used to find the roots of a nonlinear equation. This algorithm starts with an initial guess of the root, then iteratively improves the guess until it converges to a root of the equation. 

For instance, let us consider the equation  𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑥²−𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑥), which we want to solve. We can use the iterative formula: 

𝑥_(𝑛+1) = 𝑥_𝑛 − 𝑓(𝑥_𝑛)/𝑓′(𝑥_𝑛)

Where 𝑓′(𝑥) is the derivative of 𝑓(𝑥). Starting with an initial guess, we can iteratively compute the next value of 𝑥 until our tolerance level is reached.

The Newton-Raphson method is just one example of a numerical algorithm, and there are countless others, such as the Gaussian elimination method or the Simpson's rule for numerical integration, among others.
