Adapter pattern is a design pattern in which an interface can be adapted to another interface. It is used when there is a need to connect two incompatible interfaces or classes that cannot be used directly. The adapter pattern converts the original interface or class into a new interface that the client can use.

For example, suppose we have a client that expects an object to have a certain interface, but we have an object that has a different interface. In this scenario, we can create an adapter class that implements the expected interface and wraps the original object, to make it compatible with the client.

One example of adapter pattern is the use of sockets. Suppose we have an application that uses a specific socket type to communicate with a remote server. However, the server uses a different socket type. In this case, we could create an adapter class that implements the expected socket type, and internally, it uses the server's socket.

Another example is the use of a card reader. A card reader may use an interface that is incompatible with the computer or device it is attached to. In this situation, an adapter can be created to convert the card reader interface to the computer's interface. 

In summary, the Adapter pattern is used to make two incompatible interfaces work together by creating an intermediary that translates one interface to another.

List the key points of Adapter Pattern
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



The Adapter Pattern is a design pattern used to convert the interface of one class into another interface that clients expect. It involves wrapping a class with another interface that behaves similarly but has different input and output types. The key points of this pattern include:

1. Adapter converts the interface of a class into another interface based on the client's needs. 

2. To do so, it includes a "wrapper" class that contains the desired interface and typically delegates incoming requests to the underlying object. 

3. The adapter allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together, without modifying the code of the original objects. 

4. There are two types of Adapter Pattern: class adapters and object adapters. 

5. Class adapters use inheritance to adapt one interface to another, while, Object adapters use composition to delegate requests to the adaptee. 

6. The adapter pattern helps to avoid the need for refactoring legacy code by providing a solution to the incompatibility of interfaces.

7. The drawbacks of the Adapter Pattern include increased complexity, multiple layers of indirection, and sometimes increased overhead. 

8. It is widely used in real-world scenarios such as converting file formats, database drivers, and network protocols.   

## Review

Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about Adapter Pattern
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. What is Adapter Pattern?
Answer: Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows two incompatible interfaces to work together. It converts the interface of a class into another interface that the client expects.

2. What are the two main classes involved in Adapter Pattern?
Answer: The two main classes involved in Adapter Pattern are the Adapter class and the Adaptee class. The Adapter class implements the target interface and uses an instance of the Adaptee class to provide the required functionality.

3. When should Adapter Pattern be used?
Answer: Adapter Pattern should be used when you need to make two incompatible interfaces work together without modifying the existing code. It is also useful when you want to reuse an existing class, but its interface is not compatible with the rest of the system.

4. What are the advantages of using Adapter Pattern?
Answer: The advantages of using Adapter Pattern are: It allows two incompatible interfaces to work together, it enables reuse of existing classes, it helps in providing a stable interface to clients, it allows for flexibility in design and supports the open/closed principle of design.

5. Can Adapter Pattern be used in both class and object level?
Answer: Yes, Adapter Pattern can be used in both class and object level. In class level, a class adapts its interface to the target interface, while in object level, the adapter is created as an object that wraps around the Adaptee object and implements the target interface.
