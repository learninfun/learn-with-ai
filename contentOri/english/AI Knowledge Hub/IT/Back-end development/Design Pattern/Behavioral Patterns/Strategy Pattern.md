The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables an object's behavior to be changed dynamically based on the state of the system. It defines a set of algorithms, encapsulates each one of them, and makes them interchangeable. The pattern enables the algorithms to be selected during runtime based on the context of the problem at hand.

For example, consider a graphics editor that needs to support multiple file formats for image output. The system needs to be able to save files in different image formats like PNG, JPG, BMP, and GIF. To support this, we can use the strategy pattern and create a strategy for each format. Each strategy would contain the code to save an image in that format.

The Code could be:

```
interface ImageSaveStrategy {
  void save(Image image, String filename);
}

class PNGStrategy implements ImageSaveStrategy {
  void save(Image image, String filename) {
    // Implementation of saving image as PNG
  }
}

class JPGStrategy implements ImageSaveStrategy {
  void save(Image image, String filename) {
    // Implementation of saving image as JPG
  }
}

class BMPStrategy implements ImageSaveStrategy {
  void save(Image image, String filename) {
    // Implementation of saving image as BMP
  }
}

class GIFStrategy implements ImageSaveStrategy {
  void save(Image image, String filename) {
    // Implementation of saving image as GIF
  }
}
```

In the client code, we can create and set the strategy at runtime, based on the required file format.

```
class ImageEditor {
  private ImageSaveStrategy strategy;

  public void setSaveStrategy(ImageSaveStrategy strategy) {
    this.strategy = strategy;
  }

  public void save(Image image, String filename) {
    strategy.save(image, filename);
  }
}
```

The actual strategy to be used will be determined dynamically by the ImageEditor class based on the user's preference or the default format specified by the system.

1. Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows for selecting an algorithm at runtime.
2. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates them in separate classes, and makes them interchangeable.
3. It allows for modularity and flexibility in object-oriented programming.
4. It enables clients to choose from different algorithms in a straightforward and intuitive manner.
5. It separates the use of an algorithm from the implementation details of the algorithm, promoting clean code.
6. It supports the Open-Closed Principle, which enables adding new algorithms without modifying the existing code.
7. Some of the use cases for the Strategy pattern include sorting, encryption, compression, and search algorithms.   

## Review

Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about Strategy Pattern
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. What is the Strategy Pattern?
Answer: The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables an object to change its behavior at runtime by selecting from multiple algorithms or strategies.

2. What are the key components of the Strategy Pattern?
Answer: The key components of the Strategy Pattern are the context, the strategy interface, and the concrete strategy classes. The context contains a reference to the strategy interface, which is implemented by the concrete strategy classes.

3. How does the Strategy Pattern differ from other patterns?
Answer: The Strategy Pattern is different from other patterns because it emphasizes the use of composition over inheritance. This means that the behavior of an object is determined by the composition of multiple objects, rather than the inheritance of behavior from a single parent object.

4. What are some common use cases for the Strategy Pattern?
Answer: Some common use cases for the Strategy Pattern include sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and database query optimization algorithms. These use cases involve multiple strategies that can be selected at runtime based on the specific requirements of the task.

5. How does the Strategy Pattern enable code reusability and maintainability?
Answer: The Strategy Pattern enables code reusability and maintainability by encapsulating each algorithm or strategy in a separate class, which can be reused in multiple contexts. This reduces code duplication and makes it easier to modify or add new strategies without affecting the existing codebase.
