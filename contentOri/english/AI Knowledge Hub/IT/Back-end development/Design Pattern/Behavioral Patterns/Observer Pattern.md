The Observer pattern is a design pattern that allows an object, called the subject, to notify a list of observers when its state changes. This pattern is widely used in event-driven systems, where one or more observers are interested in state changes of a specific entity.

For example, let’s consider an online store that sells products. Whenever the store receives new products, it needs to notify its customers. In such a situation, the Observer pattern can come in handy. Here, Store acts as the subject, and customers act as observers. Whenever a new product is added to the store, all the customers who have subscribed to the store’s notifications will be notified about the new product. The available products list is the state of the store, and the customer’s wishlist is an example of an observer that is interested in changes in this state. 

In this pattern, observers are decoupled from the subject, which allows for easier maintenance, scalability, and reusability of code. It also makes it easier to implement new functionality without disrupting current code.   

## Keypoint

List the key points of Observer Pattern
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern used to implement event handling systems.

2. It defines an object (the subject) that maintains a list of its dependents (observers) and notifies them automatically of any state changes.

3. The pattern decouples the subject from its observers by allowing the subject to broadcast its state changes without requiring specific classes to know about each other.

4. The observer pattern has four main components: the subject (which notifies its observers), the observer (which receives updates), a subscription mechanism, and a notification method.

5. The observer pattern can be used in real-world scenarios where there is a one-to-many relationship between objects, such as stock market systems, weather monitoring applications, and user interface components.

6. The pattern allows for flexible communication between objects, as observers can be added, removed, or modified at any time without affecting the subject.

7. One potential disadvantage of this pattern is that it can lead to performance issues if there are a large number of observers that need to be notified of state changes.

8. Overall, the observer pattern is a useful tool for streamlining communication between objects and simplifying event handling in complex systems.   

## Review

Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about Observer Pattern
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. What is the Observer Pattern?
Answer: The Observer Pattern is a design pattern that allows one-to-many relationships between objects. When the state of one object changes, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

2. What are the main components of the Observer pattern?
Answer: The main components of the Observer pattern are the Observable (also known as Subject), the Observer, and the Client.

3. What is the difference between the Push model and the Pull model in the Observer pattern?
Answer: In the Push model, the updates are sent proactively by the Observable to its Observers. In the Pull model, Observers request updates from the Observable when they need them.

4. How does the Observer pattern support loose coupling between objects?
Answer: By having the Observable and Observers interact only through a common interface, the Observer pattern allows for flexible and dynamic relationships between objects, as they can be easily added or removed without affecting the system's overall functionality.

5. Can the Observer pattern be used with multithreaded systems?
Answer: Yes, it can. However, proper synchronization mechanisms need to be put in place to ensure that each Observable and Observer operates on its own thread without causing conflicts or race conditions.
