Explain Memento Pattern and give an example
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}

The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to restore its previous state. This pattern is helpful when we want to save the state of an object at a particular point in time and later restore it to that state. It preserves encapsulation and eliminates the need for exposing the entire internal state of an object to the client.

When a Memento pattern is implemented, a client can request a Memento from the originator (an object whose state is to be saved), which the originator returns. The client can then work on the object and use the Memento to restore it to its previous state if required.

An example of Memento Pattern is a text editor. Suppose you are writing an important document and after making many changes, want to restore it to the previous version. In this case, the Memento pattern can be used. Here, the text editor object is the originator, and it saves its state whenever the user issues the save command. The Memento class will store the state of the text editor and return it to the text editor if the user issues the load command. This way, the text editor could be rolled back to a previous version whenever required.   

## Keypoint

List the key points of Memento Pattern
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. The Memento Pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows an object's state to be saved and restored.
2. The pattern consists of three components: the Originator, the Memento, and the Caretaker.
3. The Originator is the object whose state is being saved and restored. It creates a Memento that contains a snapshot of its current state.
4. The Memento is an object that stores the state of the Originator at a specific point in time.
5. The Caretaker is responsible for managing a collection of Mementos and facilitating the saving and restoring of the Originator's state. It interacts with the Originator to create and restore Mementos, but it does not modify them.
6. The Memento Pattern can improve the maintainability and flexibility of an application by decoupling the state-saving and state-restoring logic from the Originator.
7. The pattern can be adapted to meet the needs of different use cases, such as undo/redo functionality, transaction management, and caching.   

## Review
{{< ask_chatgpt >}}
Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about Memento Pattern
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. What is the purpose of Memento Pattern?
Answer: Memento Pattern is used for capturing and externalizing an object's internal state, so that it can be restored later without violating encapsulation.

2. What are the three main components of the Memento Pattern?
Answer: Originator, Memento, Caretaker.

3. In what scenario is Memento Pattern useful?
Answer: Memento Pattern is useful when an object's state needs to be saved and restored, such as when undo and redo functionality is needed in an application.

4. How does Memento Pattern ensure encapsulation?
Answer: Memento Pattern ensures encapsulation by separating the object's state from the object itself, allowing the object to maintain its private data while still being able to restore its state later.

5. What is the difference between the Originator and Caretaker in the Memento Pattern?
Answer: The Originator is the object whose state needs to be saved and restored, while the Caretaker is responsible for managing the Memento objects that hold the saved states.
