The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines an abstract class containing a template method that defines the steps of an algorithm. The template method calls abstract methods, which are overridden by concrete subclasses to implement the steps of the algorithm.

Example:

A simple example of the Template Method Pattern can be to make tea. The template for making tea includes the following steps:
1. Boil water
2. Steep tea leaves in hot water
3. Add sugar and milk
4. Strain the tea

The abstract class Tea provides the template method makeTea(), which calls the abstract methods boilWater(), steepTeaLeaves(), addSugarAndMilk(), and strainTea(). 

The concrete subclass BlackTea overrides the abstract methods to implement the steps of the algorithm for making black tea, whereas the concrete subclass GreenTea overrides the abstract methods to implement the steps of the algorithm for making green tea.

Thus, the Template Method Pattern allows for the creation of a generic algorithm, while leaving the details of the implementation to the subclasses.

List the key points of Template Method Pattern
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines an algorithm in a base class, which can then be implemented by derived classes as per their own requirements.

2. The Template Method Pattern consists of a base class that provides a template method, which is a set of steps to execute the algorithm.

3. The base class also provides hooks or placeholders for the derived classes to implement their own steps in the algorithm.

4. The Template Method Pattern separates the algorithm's structure from the details of its implementation.

5. The primary benefit of the Template Method Pattern is that it allows for reuse of code, as similar algorithms can use the same base class.

6. Another benefit of the Template Method Pattern is that it promotes code reusability and extensibility, as the base class can be easily extended and customized by the derived classes.

7. The Template Method Pattern is commonly used in software frameworks and libraries, where a common set of methods is provided for the users to implement as per their requirements.

8. The Template Method Pattern can also help in improving the performance of the system by minimizing the number of objects and method calls.   

## Review

Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about Template Method Pattern
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. What is the basic idea behind the Template Method Pattern?
Answer: The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, with specific steps implemented in derived classes. This allows the algorithm to be customized while maintaining its structure.

2. How does the Template Method Pattern differ from other design patterns like the Strategy or Observer patterns?
Answer: While the Template Method Pattern provides a framework for implementing algorithms, the Strategy Pattern provides a way to dynamically change the behavior of an object, and the Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects.

3. What are the benefits of using the Template Method Pattern?
Answer: The Template Method Pattern provides a way to encapsulate common algorithms in a base class, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability. It also allows for customization of the algorithm without changing its overall structure.

4. Can the Template Method Pattern be used for complex algorithms?
Answer: Yes, the Template Method Pattern can be used for both simple and complex algorithms. However, care must be taken to ensure that the base class provides enough flexibility to accommodate different variations of the algorithm.

5. How does the Template Method Pattern relate to the Open/Closed Principle?
Answer: The Template Method Pattern is designed to adhere to the Open/Closed Principle, which states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. By defining a base class and allowing derived classes to provide specific implementations, the algorithm can be extended without modifying the original code.
