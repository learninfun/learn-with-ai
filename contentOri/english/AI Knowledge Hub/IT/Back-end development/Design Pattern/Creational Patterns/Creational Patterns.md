Creational patterns are design patterns used in object-oriented programming to help simplify object creation processes. They encapsulate object creation processes, provide flexibility in object creation, and promote code reuse.

There are five creational patterns, including the Abstract Factory pattern, Singleton pattern, Factory Method pattern, Builder pattern, and Prototype pattern.

An example of a creational pattern is the Singleton pattern. It is used to ensure a class has only one instance, while providing a global point of access. This pattern is useful in situations where only one instance of a class is needed throughout the applicationâ€”for example, a logging class, a database connection class, or a configuration class.

Here is an example of a Singleton pattern in Java:

public class SingletonExample {
  private static SingletonExample instance;

  private SingletonExample() {}

  public static SingletonExample getInstance() {
    if (instance == null) {
      instance = new SingletonExample();
    }
    return instance;
  }
}


This code ensures that only one instance of the SingletonExample class is created, and provides a global access point to that instance through the getInstance() method.

List the key points of Creational Patterns

- Creational patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
- Creational patterns are not concerned with the impact of these objects on the performance of a system, but rather focus on the way objects can be created and managed to achieve better flexibility and maintainability.
- Creational patterns provide a way to create objects without revealing the creation logic, while maintaining the flexibility of the system.
- The key points of Creational Patterns include the Singleton pattern, Prototype pattern, Factory Method pattern, Abstract Factory pattern, Builder pattern, and Object Pool pattern.
- The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created, providing a global access point to this instance.
- The Prototype pattern creates new objects by cloning existing objects, avoiding costly initialization processes.
- The Factory Method pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, while allowing subclasses to alter the individual objects they create.
- The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related objects, without specifying their concrete classes.
- The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- The Object Pool pattern creates a pool of objects that can be reused instead of being created and destroyed every time they are needed, improving overall system performance.   

## Review

Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about Creational Patterns
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. What is the Singleton pattern and when would you use it?
Answer: The Singleton pattern is a creational pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. You would use it when you need to ensure that only one instance of a class is ever created and you want a global point of access to it.

2. What is the Builder pattern and when would you use it?
Answer: The Builder pattern is a creational pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations. You would use it when you need to create complex objects that are composed of smaller objects that need to be created in a specific order.

3. What is the Factory Method pattern and when would you use it?
Answer: The Factory Method pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. You would use it when you have a superclass or interface that defines a common set of methods, but subclasses need to implement those methods differently.

4. What is the Abstract Factory pattern and when would you use it?
Answer: The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. You would use it when you need to create objects that belong to a particular group or family and you want to ensure that those objects are compatible with each other.

5. What is the Prototype pattern and when would you use it?
Answer: The Prototype pattern is a creational pattern that allows you to create new objects by cloning existing ones, without specifying their concrete classes. You would use it when you need to create new objects that are similar to existing ones, but with some variations, and you want to avoid the cost of creating those objects from scratch.
