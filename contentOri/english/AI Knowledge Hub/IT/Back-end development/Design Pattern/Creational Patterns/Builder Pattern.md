The Builder Pattern is a creational pattern that separates the creation of an object from its representation. In other words, it allows you to create an object step by step and set different values for its properties without having to expose its construction logic to the client.

An example of the builder pattern would be building a custom burger at a restaurant. The client can choose the type of bun, patty, toppings and sauces, and the builder will assemble the burger in the correct order. The builder can also validate the order to ensure that all required components are present.

Here's a simplified code example:

```
public class Burger {
    private String bun;
    private String patty;
    private List<String> toppings;
    private List<String> sauces;

    // Builder
    public static class Builder {
        private String bun;
        private String patty;
        private List<String> toppings = new ArrayList<>();
        private List<String> sauces = new ArrayList<>();

        public Builder(String bun, String patty) {
            this.bun = bun;
            this.patty = patty;
        }

        public Builder addTopping(String topping) {
            toppings.add(topping);
            return this;
        }

        public Builder addSauce(String sauce) {
            sauces.add(sauce);
            return this;
        }

        public Burger build() {
            if (toppings.isEmpty() || sauces.isEmpty()) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("Burger is incomplete");
            }
            Burger burger = new Burger();
            burger.bun = this.bun;
            burger.patty = this.patty;
            burger.toppings = this.toppings;
            burger.sauces = this.sauces;
            return burger;
        }
    }

    // Getters
    public String getBun() {
        return bun;
    }

    public String getPatty() {
        return patty;
    }

    public List<String> getToppings() {
        return toppings;
    }

    public List<String> getSauces() {
        return sauces;
    }
}
```

The client can now create a burger like this:

```
Burger burger = new Burger.Builder("sesame seed bun", "beef patty")
                    .addTopping("lettuce")
                    .addTopping("tomato")
                    .addSauce("ketchup")
                    .addSauce("mayonnaise")
                    .build();
```

If the client misses any of the required components, like toppings or sauces, the builder will throw an exception. This ensures that the burger is always built according to the restaurant's standards.   

## Keypoint

List the key points of Builder Pattern
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. The builder pattern is a design pattern used to create complex objects by separating the construction of an object from its representation.
2. It is used to create objects that have a large number of possible configurations or complex parameterization.
3. The builder pattern is useful when creating objects that require different combinations or variations of attributes, parameters, or options.
4. It eliminates the need to create multiple constructors or methods to create different variations of an object, making the code more scalable and maintainable.
5. The builder pattern consists of a builder class that is responsible for creating and assembling the different parts of an object.
6. The builder class provides a fluent interface that allows the object to be configured through a set of chaining methods.
7. Once the object has been fully configured, the builder class returns the complete object to the client code.
8. It is common to implement the builder pattern using a fluent interface and method chaining to make the code more readable and concise.
9. The builder pattern can also be used in conjunction with other design patterns, such as the factory method pattern, to create more complex objects.
10. Overall, the builder pattern improves code flexibility, readability, and maintainability, making it a useful tool for creating complex objects in software development.   

## Review

Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about Builder Pattern
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. What is Builder Pattern?
Answer: Builder Pattern is a design pattern that is used to create complex objects, which are made up of various smaller objects, in a step-by-step manner. 

2. How does Builder Pattern differ from Factory Pattern?
Answer: While Factory Pattern is used to create various objects of a specific class, Builder Pattern follows a construction process to gradually build up the final object by adding smaller objects to it. 

3. What are the advantages of using Builder Pattern?
Answer: Builder Pattern helps in creating complex objects in a simplified and organized manner, ensuring that the final object is consistent and complete. It also allows for code reusability and easy maintenance. 

4. In which situations is Builder Pattern most useful?
Answer: Builder Pattern comes in handy when dealing with objects that have multiple components that need to be assembled in a particular order, or when creating objects with optional or mandatory parameters that can vary based on user input. 

5. Can Builder Pattern be used in multiple programming languages?
Answer: Yes, Builder Pattern is a general design pattern that can be implemented in various programming languages like Java, C++, Python, and others.
