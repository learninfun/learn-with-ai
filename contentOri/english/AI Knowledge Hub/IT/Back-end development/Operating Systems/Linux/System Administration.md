1) What is the purpose of a firewall in a system administration context? 
Answer: A firewall is used to control network traffic and prevent unauthorized access to a network or system. 

2) What is the difference between a physical server and a virtual server? 
Answer: A physical server is a physical, tangible machine, while a virtual server is a software-based emulation of a physical server that can be created, deleted, or dynamically allocated as needed. 

3) How can you monitor system performance and identify bottlenecks on a server? 
Answer: Various tools can be used to monitor system performance, including performance counters, system logs, and third-party monitoring software. Bottlenecks can be identified by examining resource utilization levels and response times. 

4) What is RAID, and why is it important in system administration? 
Answer: RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is a method of combining multiple hard drives into one logical unit to provide improved performance, protection against data loss, and increased storage capacity. It is essential in system administration as it helps ensure data availability and system uptime. 

5) What are some common security measures that should be implemented on a server? 
Answer: Common security measures that should be implemented on a server include using strong passwords, keeping operating systems and software up-to-date with security patches, implementing firewalls and anti-malware software, and restricting physical and remote access to the server.
