A Min Heap is a special type of binary heap where the value of each parent node is smaller than or equal to its children. It means that the smallest element is always at the root. This property is called the “min-heap property.”

For example, consider the following binary tree:

        6
      /   \
     7     12
    / \    / \
  10  15  14  20

This is not a valid min heap because the parent node (6) is larger than its children (7 and 12). We can convert this into a min heap by swapping the values of the parent node with its smallest child until the min heap property is satisfied.

After the conversion, the new min heap will look like this:

        6
      /   \
    7      12
   / \    / \
  10 15  14 20

Now, the smallest element (6) is at the root and satisfies the min-heap property. We can use min heap to implement various algorithms such as priority queues, sorting algorithms like heap sort, and graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm.

List the key points of Min Heap
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. A Min Heap is a complete binary tree where each node has a value smaller than or equal to its children.
2. The root of the Min Heap is always the minimum value of the heap.
3. Operations like insertion, deletion, and retrieval have a time complexity of O(log n) in a Min Heap.
4. A Min Heap can be represented using an array, where the left child of node i is at index 2i+1, and the right child is at index 2i+2.
5. A Min Heap is useful for implementing priority queues and sorting algorithms like heapsort.
6. The Min Heap property ensures that the highest priority item is always at the top of the heap and can be accessed quickly.
7. When the root node is removed from a Min Heap, the next smallest element in the heap takes its place, maintaining the Min Heap property.   

## Review

Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about Min Heap
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. What is a Min Heap?
Answer: A Min Heap is a binary tree where the value of each parent node is less than or equal to the value of its left and right child nodes.

2. How is a Min Heap different from a Max Heap?
Answer: The main difference between a Min Heap and a Max Heap is that in a Max Heap, the value of each parent node is greater than or equal to the value of its left and right child nodes.

3. What is the time complexity of inserting an element in a Min Heap?
Answer: The time complexity of inserting an element in a Min Heap is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the heap.

4. How can we extract the minimum element from a Min Heap?
Answer: To extract the minimum element from a Min Heap, we remove the root node and replace it with the last element in the last level of the heap. Then we "heapify" the tree by comparing the new root node with its children and swapping if required.

5. Can a Min Heap have duplicate elements?
Answer: Yes, a Min Heap can have duplicate elements.
