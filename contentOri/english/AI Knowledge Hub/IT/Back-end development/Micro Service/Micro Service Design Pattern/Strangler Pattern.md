The Strangler Pattern is a software development technique used to replace an existing system (or part of it) with an improved version gradually, without disrupting the existing system's functionality. The goal of this approach is to reduce the risks and costs associated with a sudden full-scale replacement of an existing system. The Strangler Pattern is named after the way in which some plants grow by wrapping around a host tree and eventually replacing it.

An example of the Strangler Pattern involves the development of a new version of an e-commerce website that needs to be introduced gradually to the system's clients. Instead of replacing the entire website at once, the development team may identify critical parts of the website that need upgrading, such as the product pages or user registration functionality. The team could then build new microservices that offer the same functionality as the existing system, but with the new features included. These microservices can be integrated with the existing website in a controlled manner, allowing the development team to monitor and test the new features' performance and stability.

As the new microservices are rolled out and gain momentum, they take over more of the website's functionality until the entire website has been replaced. By using the Strangler Pattern, the development team can reduce the risks and costs associated with a full-scale replacement while ensuring that the new website is more reliable and user-friendly.   

## Keypoint

List the key points of Strangler Pattern
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. The Strangler Pattern is a software architecture pattern that enables the gradual replacement of legacy systems with new ones, without disrupting the existing workflows and customer experience.

2. The core idea of the Strangler Pattern is to create a new system that absorbs the functionalities of the old one, bit by bit, until the legacy system has been entirely replaced.

3. To implement the Strangler Pattern, developers create a facade layer around the legacy system, which enables the redirection of traffic to the new system without compromising the user's experience or workflow.

4. The Strangler Pattern works best when the legacy system is modular and loosely coupled, enabling the replacement of each component or module incrementally, without affecting the other parts.

5. The Strangler Pattern is also useful in situations where the existing system is too complex to replace entirely within a limited period.

6. Advantages of the Strangler Pattern include the reduction of risks associated with the complete replacement of a legacy system and the ability to deliver value to users gradually.

7. Potential disadvantages of the Strangler Pattern include the increased complexity of having two systems running in tandem, and the need for careful planning to ensure a smooth transition.
