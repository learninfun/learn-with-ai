Explain Validation Set and give an example
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}

Validation set is a subset of data used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model during its training phase. It is used to fine-tune the model's parameters and to validate its performance before making predictions on new unseen data.

For example, let's say you want to build a machine learning model that predicts the price of a house based on its features such as the number of rooms, the age of the house, and the location. You have a dataset of 1000 houses where you know the price and the features. You can divide this dataset into three parts: 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. 

You train your machine learning model on the 700 houses of your training dataset, using different algorithms and hyperparameters. You then evaluate the model on the 150 houses of your validation dataset, measuring its accuracy and choosing the best model that performs well on the validation dataset.

Once you have selected the best model, you then test it on the remaining 150 houses of your testing dataset to make sure it performs well on unseen data. This process helps to prevent overfitting, i.e., the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new unseen data.   

## Keypoint

List the key points of Validation Set
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}

1. The validation set is a subset of data used to assess the performance of a model during training.

2. It is an independent sample of data not used in the training set and not seen by the model during training.

3. The purpose of the validation set is to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model is too complex and tries to fit the training data too closely.

4. The validation set helps to tune the hyperparameters of the model, such as learning rate, batch size, and architecture.

5. The performance of the model on the validation set is used as an estimate of how well the model will perform on unseen data.

6. The validation set is usually split from the original data set, typically after the training set has been created.

7. A large validation set size ensures that the performance of the model on new data is reliable, while a small validation set size can lead to overfitting and poor generalization of the model. 

8. The validation set is used to make a final evaluation of the model before it is used for prediction on the test set or real-world data.   

## Review
{{< ask_chatgpt >}}
Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about Validation Set
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}

1. What is a validation set in machine learning?
Answer: A validation set is a subset of the training data that is used to tune model hyperparameters and evaluate model performance during the training process.

2. How is a validation set used in the training process?
Answer: A validation set is used to test the performance of the model during training, which allows for adjustments to be made to hyperparameters and prevent overfitting to the training data.

3. What is the difference between a validation set and a test set in machine learning?
Answer: A validation set is used during the training process to tune model hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, while a test set is used after training to evaluate the final performance of the model on unseen data.

4. What are some common techniques used for creating a validation set?
Answer: Some common techniques for creating a validation set include random sampling, stratified sampling, and time series splitting.

5. What are some best practices for using a validation set in machine learning?
Answer: Best practices for using a validation set include using the same random seed for reproducibility, using cross-validation to reduce variance, and minimizing data leakage between the training and validation sets.
