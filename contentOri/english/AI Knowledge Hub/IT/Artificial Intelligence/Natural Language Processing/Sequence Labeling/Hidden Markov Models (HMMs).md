Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are statistical models used to predict a sequence of unknown variables (hidden states) based on a sequence of observed variables. 

HMMs consist of two types of variables: hidden states and observed states. The hidden states cannot be directly observed but can be inferred based on the observed states. The observed states are the observable data points that are used to infer the hidden states.

HMMs operate based on the assumption that the probability of observing an observed state depends on the hidden state. HMMs are useful in a variety of applications, such as speech recognition, bioinformatics, and natural language processing.

An example of HMM usage would be in language recognition. A machine learning model can be trained using HMMs to recognize different languages. The hidden states in the model could represent different languages while the observed states could represent the sounds of different words. The model could be used to determine the most likely language based on the sequence of observed states. For instance, if the model receives the sequence of sounds "hola," it could calculate that it is most likely a Spanish language sequence.   

## Keypoint
{{< ask_chatgpt >}}
List the key points of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}

1. HMMs are a statistical model used to model sequence data where the underlying process is assumed to be a Markov process.

2. HMMs consist of a set of states, a set of observations, and a transition matrix.

3. Each state is associated with a probability distribution over the observations.

4. The transition matrix describes the probability of transitioning from one state to another.

5. HMMs can be used to perform a number of tasks, including sequence prediction, classification, and clustering.

6. The main advantage of HMMs is that they can model complex sequences with a high degree of accuracy.

7. HMMs are widely used in applications such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and genetic sequence analysis.

8. HMMs are typically trained using the Baum-Welch (or EM) algorithm, which involves maximizing the likelihood of the observed data given the model parameters.

9. HMMs can be extended to include additional features, such as multiple observations per state, or a continuous emission distribution.

10. Despite their usefulness, HMMs have some limitations, including their assumption of a Markov process and the difficulty of interpreting the model parameters.   

## Review
{{< ask_chatgpt >}}
Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}

1. What is the difference between a hidden state and an observed state in a Hidden Markov Model? 
Answer: In an HMM, a hidden state is a state that cannot be observed directly, while an observed state is a state that can be observed directly.

2. How does the Viterbi algorithm work in an HMM? 
Answer: The Viterbi algorithm is used to find the most likely sequence of hidden states given a sequence of observed states. It does this by recursively calculating the probability of the most likely path to each state at each time step, and then backtracking to find the path with the highest probability.

3. What is the difference between a left-to-right HMM and a fully connected HMM? 
Answer: In a left-to-right HMM, the hidden states are arranged in a linear sequence, and each state is connected only to the states that appear later in the sequence. In a fully connected HMM, each hidden state is connected to every other state.

4. What is the purpose of the forward algorithm in an HMM? 
Answer: The forward algorithm is used to calculate the probability of a given sequence of observed states given the model parameters. This is useful for tasks such as speech recognition, where we want to determine the probability of a particular word or phrase given the audio input.

5. How do you train an HMM using the Baum-Welch algorithm? 
Answer: The Baum-Welch algorithm is an iterative procedure for estimating the parameters of an HMM from a set of training data. It works by first initializing the model parameters, then iteratively improving them by using the forward-backward algorithm to calculate the probabilities of the hidden states given the observed data, and then updating the parameters based on these probabilities. This process continues until the model parameters converge to a stable solution.
