k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) is a machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis. It is a non-parametric algorithm that works by finding the k number of closest data points in the input space and then predicts the class or value of the new data point based on the majority class or average value of the k nearest neighbors.

For example, consider a dataset that contains information about different types of fruits and whether they are sweet or sour. The dataset contains attributes such as color, shape, size, and taste. Now, suppose we have a new fruit that we want to classify as sweet or sour based on its attributes.

Using the k-NN algorithm, we first select the value of k, say k=3. Then, we find the three fruits in the dataset that are closest to the new fruit in terms of the attributes. The majority class of these three fruits is then considered as the predicted class for the new fruit.

For instance, if the three closest fruits are all sweet, then the new fruit is predicted to be sweet as well. On the other hand, if two of the three closest fruits are sour, and one is sweet, then the new fruit is predicted to be sour.

List the key points of k-Nearest Neighbors
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}

1. The k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm is a non-parametric and lazy supervised learning algorithm which is used for classification and regression tasks.
2. It works by finding the k closest data points to a new observation in the feature space and then assigning the label of the most common class among those k points as the prediction for the new observation.
3. The distance metric used to calculate distances between data points is usually Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance.
4. The choice of k has a significant impact on the model's performance, and it is typically chosen by cross-validation or other empirical methods.
5. The k-NN algorithm has high computational complexity when dealing with large datasets, and its performance can be improved with techniques such as dimensionality reduction, data normalization, and distance weighting.
6. The k-NN algorithm can suffer from the curse of dimensionality, as the distance between data points becomes less meaningful in high-dimensional spaces.
7. The k-NN algorithm is sensitive to noisy data and outliers, which can negatively affect its performance.   

## Review
{{< ask_chatgpt >}}
Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about k-Nearest Neighbors
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}

1. What is k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)? 
Answer: k-NN is a non-parametric algorithm used for classification and regression. It determines the class (or value) of a new sample by comparing it to k nearest samples in the training set.

2. How is the value of k chosen in k-NN? 
Answer: The value of k is chosen based on the size of the training set and the complexity of the problem. Typically, a small value of k is chosen for simple problems and a larger value of k is chosen for more complex problems.

3. What is the curse of dimensionality in k-NN? 
Answer: The curse of dimensionality refers to the problem of increasing computational complexity as the number of features (dimensions) in the data increases. This can make it difficult for k-NN to find the nearest neighbors due to the large number of possible combinations.

4. What is the difference between weightage voting and uniform voting in k-NN? 
Answer: In weightage voting, the nearest neighbors are weighted based on their distances, and the predicted class (or value) is determined by the sum of the weighted votes. In uniform voting, all nearest neighbors are given equal weights, and the predicted class is determined by the majority vote.

5. What are some applications of k-NN? 
Answer: k-NN is used in a variety of applications, such as image recognition, recommendation systems, anomaly detection, and fraud detection. It is especially useful when the data is high-dimensional and the decision boundaries are complex.
