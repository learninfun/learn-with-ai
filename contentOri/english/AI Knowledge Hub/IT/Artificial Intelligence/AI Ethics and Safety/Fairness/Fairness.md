Fairness refers to the treatment or distribution of resources, opportunities, and benefits in a just and equitable manner, without any form of discrimination or bias. It involves giving equal consideration and respect to all individuals, regardless of their background, status, or identity.

For example, in a classroom, fairness would mean that each student is given equal opportunity to participate and contribute to discussions or activities, regardless of their gender, ethnic background, or academic ability. The teacher would ensure that each student is given the same amount of time and attention, and that grades and evaluations are based solely on merit and not affected by any personal biases. This creates a more inclusive and respectful learning environment, where everyone feels valued and supported.
