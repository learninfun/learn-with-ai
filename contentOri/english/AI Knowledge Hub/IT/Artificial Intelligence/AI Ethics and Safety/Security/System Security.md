{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}

1. What measures are used to protect against unauthorized access to a computer system?
2. How are passwords managed and secured to prevent breaches?
3. What steps are taken to prevent malware and viruses from infecting a computer network?
4. How are sensitive data and information protected from insider threats or theft?
5. What is the procedure for responding to a security breach or attack, and how is the system repaired and strengthened following such an incident?   

## Explain

Explain System Security and give an example
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}

System security refers to the measures and methods used to protect computer systems and networks from unauthorized access, theft, damage, or other threats. It includes various policies, procedures, and technologies that help to prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to critical assets or data, and to detect and respond to any security breaches or incidents.

An example of system security would be the use of firewalls and intrusion detection systems to prevent unauthorized access to a corporate network. Firewalls can block incoming traffic from unknown IP addresses or restrict specific types of traffic, while intrusion detection systems can monitor network activity for suspicious behavior and alert administrators if an attack or unauthorized access attempt is detected. Additional security measures such as access control policies, encryption, and regular software updates can also enhance system security and protect against various types of cyber threats.   

## Keypoint

List the key points of System Security
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}

- Confidentiality: Protection of sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure. 
- Integrity: Ensuring that information and systems are accurate and secure from modification or deletion.
- Availability: Ensuring that systems and information are accessible and functional when needed.
- Authentication: Verifying the identity of users or systems to prevent unauthorized access. 
- Authorization: Granting or denying access to resources based on a user's role, permissions, or credentials. 
- Auditability: Keeping track of system and user activity for accountability and traceability purposes. 
- Physical Security: Protecting hardware, software, and data from physical theft, damage, or destruction. 
- Network Security: Protecting data transmission and communication channels from unauthorized access, interception, or modification. 
- Application Security: Ensuring that software applications are secure and free from vulnerabilities or bugs. 
- Incident Management: Having a plan in place to detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents or breaches.   

## Review

Give me 5 medium-difficulty questions with answers about System Security
{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}

1. What is a firewall and how does it protect a system? 
Answer: A firewall is a security program that monitors and restricts network traffic based on predetermined security rules, helping to prevent unauthorized access to a system.

2. What is social engineering and how can it compromise system security?
Answer: Social engineering involves manipulating individuals into divulging sensitive or confidential information that can then be used to gain unauthorized access to a system.

3. What is encryption and why is it important in system security?
Answer: Encryption is the process of transforming data into a code that can only be read by someone with the decryption key. It's important in system security because it can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential information.

4. What is a vulnerability scan and why is it important to perform regularly on a system?
Answer: A vulnerability scan is a type of security assessment that identifies weaknesses in a system that can be exploited by attackers. Regularly performing vulnerability scans can help to identify and fix security flaws before they can be exploited.

5. What is multi-factor authentication and why is it important for system security?
Answer: Multi-factor authentication involves using two or more methods of authentication to verify the identity of a user before granting access to a system. It's important for system security because it can help to prevent unauthorized access in the event that one method of authentication is compromised.
