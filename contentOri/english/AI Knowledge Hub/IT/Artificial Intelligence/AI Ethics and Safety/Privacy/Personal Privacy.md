Personal privacy refers to an individual's right to protect their personal information, relationships, and activities from being disclosed or monitored without their consent. This includes information such as medical records, financial information, personal communication, and internet activity.

For example, a person may choose to keep their medical records private to protect their sensitive health information from being shared with unauthorized individuals. They may also choose to use privacy settings on their social media accounts to limit the audience of their personal posts or photos, maintaining their privacy from the general public. Privacy is important because it allows individuals to maintain control over their personal information and protect themselves against identity theft, fraud, and other forms of exploitation.
