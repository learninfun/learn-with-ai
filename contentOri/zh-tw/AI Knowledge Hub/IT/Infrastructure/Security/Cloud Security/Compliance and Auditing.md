Compliance指的是遵守法律、政策、流程和標準，並以明確的專業標準來確保組織和個人的行為是正確的。而Auditing則是指評估和檢查組織的財務報表、操作流程、風險管理計畫等，以確保其符合標準和規定。

舉例來說，一家銀行需要保持合規性，以確保遵守政府和監管機構的法律和標準。該行將建立合規性計劃進行監督，其中包括對其業務行為的檢查和評估，確保所有操作符合規定。此外，銀行的稽核部門會進行定期稽核，檢查銀行的會計報表、金融產品和風險控制措施等，以確保銀行的運作和操作符合所有規定和程序。透過這些Compliance and Auditing的程序，銀行可以保持合規並避免財務、法律和聲譽方面的風險。
