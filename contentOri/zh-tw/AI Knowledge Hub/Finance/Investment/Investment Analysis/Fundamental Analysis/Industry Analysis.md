產業分析（Industry Analysis）是一項評估市場競爭和機會的技術，它通常與市場研究和競爭情報相結合。其目的是了解產業的概況，評估產業未來的發展趨勢，以及了解需求和供應之間的平衡。產業分析可以作為投資或企業決策制定的基礎，從而幫助企業提高獲利。

以下是產業分析的幾個關鍵要素：

1. 市場規模和成長：檢查產業市場的規模和增長潛力，確定產業的潛在需求，了解市場的供需平衡情況。

2. 市場份額和競爭格局：確定競爭者的市場份額，以及公司在該市場的地位。瞭解產業中各競爭者的策略和優勢，了解行業内各市場份额的提升和下降原因。

3. 國際競爭：評估國際市場競爭狀況。這包括競爭者、產品和市場規模。

4. 行業風險：了解產業的風險，包括政治風險、技術風險、供應鏈風險、法律風險、金融風險等等。

5. 關鍵成功因素：了解成功在該市場的關鍵因素，以及對這些因素的影響。

一種的產業分析方法是五力分析法（five forces analysis）。五力分析法是一種分析行業競爭環境的框架，由哈佛商學院的教授Michael Porter提出。這個框架考慮五個相互作用的力量：競爭压力、新进入者压力、供应商和买家的谈判能力、替代品的压力及相关性，以及產業內競爭者之間的竞争。

舉例如下，對幾個行業進行五力分析：

1. 醫療產業 - 競爭者、新進入者、买家和供应商的谈判能力都比较弱，但是品牌由于覆盖面积小，较容易受到替代品的威胁。

2. 食品工业 - 竞争者、替代品和买卖双方的谈判力量都很强，但由于对传统品牌的信赖度较高，在某些方面可以保持竞争优势。

3. 银行业 - 竞争对手较多，买着和卖家的谈判能力相对较强。同时，新进入者的缺乏意味着就算某些方面不怎么成功也可以在这个行业上有很大的利润。

4. 科技行业 - 竞争性非常激烈，买家的谈判能力较弱，而供应商和新进入者潜力都很大。

5. 教育行业 - 竞争者、新进入者和替代品的压力都比较小，但买家和供应商之间的谈判能力较大，缺乏规模可以是挑战的重要原因。
