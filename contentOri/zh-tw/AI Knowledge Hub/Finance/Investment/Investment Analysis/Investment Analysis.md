Investment Analysis是指對潛在投資項目進行全面性、系統性的分析和評估，以確定其是否值得投資。

投資分析的目的是幫助投資者或公司做出理性的投資決策，通常包括以下幾個步驟：

1. 收集資料和進行初步分析：透過各式各樣的資料進行相關的分析和擬定未來展望趨勢，資料可能包括財務報表、市場趨勢、產業結構等等。

2. 利用各式工具進行分析：主要透過財務分析、投資評估、風險評估、估價、競爭分析等評估工具，來深入了解潛在投資項目的利潤、風險性質和投資回報率，評估投資風險。

3. 制定投資方案：綜合考慮各種因素評估結果，制訂出最佳的投資方案，以達到預期的利潤。

4. 監控投資進展：定期檢查和監控投資計劃實行進度，進行調整和改進。

例如，如果您想要投資一間公司的股票，您可以透過投資分析來評估公司是否值得投資。您可以檢視財務報表、競爭對手分析，然後進行財務分析，如收益率、現金流量、淨利潤等。您可以估算風險，如市場波動、競爭局勢變化。根據投資分析結果，制定出最佳的投資方案，定期檢查和監控投資進展，以最大化投資回報率。

{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. A company's stock has a beta of 1.25 and an expected return of 10%. The risk-free rate is 2% and the market return is 8%. What is the company's alpha?

Answer: Alpha = Expected Return - (Risk-Free Rate + Beta * (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate)) = 10% - (2% + 1.25 * (8% - 2%)) = 4.5%

2. An investor is considering two different investments that both have the same expected return of 12%. Investment A has a standard deviation of 15% and Investment B has a standard deviation of 30%. Which investment has a higher risk-adjusted return, as measured by the Sharpe ratio?

Answer: Sharpe Ratio = (Expected Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Standard Deviation. For Investment A: Sharpe Ratio = (12% - Risk-Free Rate) / 15% ; for Investment B: Sharpe Ratio = (12% - Risk-Free Rate) / 30%. Since both investments have the same expected return, the one with the lower standard deviation (Investment A) will have a higher Sharpe ratio and therefore a higher risk-adjusted return.

3. A company has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 20 and earnings per share (EPS) of $2.50. What is the company's stock price?

Answer: Stock Price = P/E Ratio * EPS = 20 * $2.50 = $50

4. An investor buys a bond with a face value of $1,000, a coupon rate of 6%, and a maturity of 5 years. If the current market interest rate is 5%, what is the bond's price?

Answer: PV of coupon payments = Coupon Payment * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r] = $60 * [(1 - (1 + 5%)^-5) / 5%] = $268.88. PV of face value = Face Value / (1 + r)^n = $1,000 / (1 + 5%)^5 = $783.53. Bond Price = PV of coupon payments + PV of face value = $268.88 + $783.53 = $1,052.41

5. A mutual fund charges a front-end load of 3%, a 12b-1 fee of 0.5% annually, and has an expense ratio of 1.25%. If an investor buys $10,000 worth of shares and holds them for 10 years with an average annual return of 8%, what is the investor's ending balance?

Answer: The front-end load reduces the initial investment to $9,700. The 12b-1 fee reduces the value every year by 0.5% of the average balance, or $48.50 in the first year. The expense ratio reduces the value every year by 1.25% of the average balance, or $121.25 in the first year. Thus, the investor's effective return in the first year is (8% - 3% - 0.5% - 1.25%) = 3.25%. After 10 years, the ending balance will be : $9,700 * (1 + 3.25%)^10 = $14,408.64.
