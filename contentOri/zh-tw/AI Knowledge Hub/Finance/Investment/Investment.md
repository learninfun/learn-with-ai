Investment是指在某個產業或企業投入資金或資產，以期望在未來獲得更高的回報或利潤的行為。

舉例，假設您投資了一家新興的科技公司，購買的是該公司的股票。這種投資可以獲得兩種回報：股價上漲及公司發放的股息。可以想像，隨著公司業績的提升，該公司的股票價格會上漲，當您售出股票時，您會獲得巨額利潤。此外，如果公司决定向股東發放股息，您將獲得現金支付。這就是投資者期望的高回報。

另外，投資不僅僅關於股票投資，也可以是房地產、債券、金融商品等等形式的投資。而這些產業的投資方式表現也有所不同。

總之，投資是一個充滿高風險和高回報機會的活動。要成功地投資，需要充分研究和了解投資領域，並謹慎地計畫和執行投資行動。

1. Company A's stock has a beta of 1.5 while Company B's stock has a beta of 0.8. If the market has an expected rate of return of 10%, what would be the expected return for each stock?

Answer:
For Company A: 10% + (1.5 x (10% - 5%)) = 15%
For Company B: 10% + (0.8 x (10% - 5%)) = 14%

2. An investor purchases a bond at a discount for $900 which matures in 5 years with a face value of $1,000. If the bond pays semi-annual coupon payments at a rate of 6%, what will be the investor's yield to maturity?

Answer:
PV = $900
FV = $1,000
PMT = $30 (=$1,000 x 6% / 2)
n = 10 (5 x 2)
Using a financial calculator or Excel, the yield to maturity is calculated to be 3.89%

3. Company X has a current stock price of $50 per share with earnings per share (EPS) of $2.50. If the company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 20, what is the company's expected growth rate?

Answer:
P/E ratio = 20
EPS = $2.50
Price per share = $50
Therefore, the expected growth rate is 10% (=20 x $2.50 / $50)

4. A mutual fund has a net asset value (NAV) per share of $30 and charges a front-end load of 5%. If an investor purchases 100 shares of the fund, what will be the total cost of the investment?

Answer:
NAV per share = $30
Front-end load = 5%
Purchase amount = 100 shares x $30 = $3,000
Load fee = $3,000 x 5% = $150
Total cost = $3,000 + $150 = $3,150

5. An investor purchases a call option on Company Y's stock with a strike price of $50 for a premium of $2 per share. If the stock's price at expiration is $60, what is the investor's profit per share?

Answer:
Profit per share = ($60 - $50) - $2 = $8
(Note: The investor paid a $2 premium, so the break-even point for this call option would have been at a stock price of $52)
