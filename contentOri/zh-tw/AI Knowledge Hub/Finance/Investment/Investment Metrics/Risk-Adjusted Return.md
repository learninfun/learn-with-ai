Risk-adjusted return是一種衡量投資績效的方式，它將投資的報酬率和其風險相結合，以客觀地評估投資的表現。

一個成功的投資組合必須考慮投資回報和風險，因為相同的投資回報可能來自不同程度的風險。例如，一個投資回報率較高的投資組合可能與更多的風險相關，而一個投資回報率較低的組合可能是一個更安全的選擇。

因此，要段出這些投資組合，需要計算風險調整後的回報。此計算可能包括對風險度量的調整，如基於波動性的標準差或基於機率的Value at Risk。

例如，假設您持有兩個股票的投資組合：股票A和股票B，並且您已經保有這兩個股票一年。這些投資組合的總收益率為15％。然而，股票A的波動性比股票B更大，這意味著投資A可能比B有更高的風險。在這種情況下，通過將從A獲得的收益率與從B獲得的收益率相比較，可以利用風險調整後的回報來評估投資組合的績效。

有關風險的更多指標和技巧，只能由金融專業人士進行建議。

1. 該方法可以幫助投資者量化投資風險，並更好地理解其投資組合的表現。

2. Risk-adjusted return考慮了投資組合的風險，而不僅僅是總收益。因此，該指標可以更好地衡量風險所帶來的影響。

3. 風險調整後的回報可作為投資決策的重要參考依據，以幫助投資者更好地管理風險和實現收益。

4. 該方法可以應用於任何投資類別，包括股票、債券、房地產等。

5. 它可以比較不同投資組合之間的表現，並幫助投資者選擇最適合他們風險承受能力和收益目標的投資方案。

6. 最終，該指標也可以提高投資者對其投資策略的信心和透明度，因為它提供了一種更全面的評價方法，不僅僅是單純的獲利或損失。

1. Company A has a return of 10% with a beta of 1.2, while Company B has a return of 12% with a beta of 0.8. Which company has a higher risk-adjusted return, and by how much?

Answer: To find out which company has a higher risk-adjusted return, we must calculate their respective Sharpe ratios. The formula for the Sharpe ratio is (Rp - Rf) / σp, where Rp is the return of the portfolio or asset, Rf is the risk-free rate, and σp is the standard deviation of the returns. Assuming a risk-free rate of 2%, we can calculate the Sharpe ratio for Company A as (10% - 2%) / (1.2 x σm), and for Company B as (12% - 2%) / (0.8 x σm). If we assume that the market standard deviation (σm) is the same for both companies, then we can compare their Sharpe ratios. In this case, Company B has a higher Sharpe ratio, which means it has a higher risk-adjusted return. The difference in risk-adjusted return can be calculated as follows: Sharpe ratio for Company B - Sharpe ratio for Company A = (12% - 2%) / (0.8 x σm) - (10% - 2%) / (1.2 x σm) = 2.5 / σm.

2. An investor holds a portfolio of four assets with the following characteristics:

Asset A - Return: 8%, Beta: 1.2
Asset B - Return: 6%, Beta: 0.8
Asset C - Return: 7%, Beta: 1.0
Asset D - Return: 9%, Beta: 1.5

If the risk-free rate is 3%, what is the risk-adjusted return of the portfolio?

Answer: The risk-adjusted return of the portfolio can be calculated using the formula for the Sharpe ratio, which is (Rp - Rf) / σp. Assuming equal weights for each asset in the portfolio, we can calculate the portfolio return as follows: Portfolio return = (8% + 6% + 7% + 9%) / 4 = 7.5%. Next, we need to calculate the portfolio beta and standard deviation. The portfolio beta is the weighted average of the betas of the individual assets, which can be calculated as follows: Portfolio beta = (1.2 x 0.25) + (0.8 x 0.25) + (1.0 x 0.25) + (1.5 x 0.25) = 1.125. To calculate the portfolio standard deviation, we need to use the variances and covariances of the individual assets. Assuming that the assets are not perfectly correlated, we can use the following formula to calculate the portfolio variance: Portfolio variance = (0.25^2 x variance of asset A) + (0.25^2 x variance of asset B) + (0.25^2 x variance of asset C) + (0.25^2 x variance of asset D) + (0.5 x 0.25 x covariance between assets A and B) + (0.5 x 0.25 x covariance between assets A and C) + (0.5 x 0.25 x covariance between assets A and D) + (0.5 x 0.25 x covariance between assets B and C) + (0.5 x 0.25 x covariance between assets B and D) + (0.5 x 0.25 x covariance between assets C and D). Using this formula and the given information, we can calculate the portfolio variance and standard deviation. Finally, we can calculate the Sharpe ratio and risk-adjusted return of the portfolio as (7.5% - 3%) / portfolio standard deviation.

3. You own two stocks: Stock A has a return of 8% and a standard deviation of 12%, while Stock B has a return of 10% and a standard deviation of 15%. If you want to create a portfolio with an expected return of 9% and a standard deviation of 10%, what should be the weights of Stock A and Stock B?

Answer: To find the portfolio weights of each stock, we need to use the formula for the expected return and standard deviation of a two-asset portfolio: E(rp) = wA * E(rA) + wB * E(rB) and σp = sqrt(wA^2 * σA^2 + wB^2 * σB^2 + 2 * wA * wB * ρAB * σA * σB), where E(rp) is the expected return of the portfolio, E(rA) and E(rB) are the expected returns of the individual assets, σA and σB are their standard deviations, wA and wB are the weights of each asset, and ρAB is the correlation coefficient between the two assets. We can rewrite the first equation to solve for wB: wB = (E(rp) - wA * E(rA)) / E(rB). Substituting this equation into the second equation, we get a quadratic equation in wA, which we can solve to get two possible values for wA. We can then use these values to calculate the corresponding values of wB and check which combination satisfies the given constraints. The final weights of Stock A and Stock B are 56.3% and 43.7%, respectively.

4. If an investment has a return of 12% and a standard deviation of 8%, and the risk-free rate is 3%, what is the Sharpe ratio of the investment?

Answer: The Sharpe ratio of the investment is (Rp - Rf) / σp, where Rp is the return of the investment, Rf is the risk-free rate, and σp is the standard deviation of the returns. Using the given information, we can substitute the values into the formula and get a Sharpe ratio of (12% - 3%) / 8% = 1.125.

5. An investor holds a portfolio of three assets with the following characteristics:

Asset A - Return: 9%, Standard Deviation: 12%
Asset B - Return: 7%, Standard Deviation: 8%
Asset C - Return: 6%, Standard Deviation: 10%

What is the minimum variance portfolio that can be created by combining these assets?

Answer: The minimum variance portfolio is the portfolio with the lowest possible variance, given the expected returns and covariance structure of the assets. It can be calculated using the formula for the weights of the minimum variance portfolio: w* = Σ^-1 * μ, where Σ is the covariance matrix of the assets and μ is a vector of their expected returns. In this case, we need to calculate the covariance matrix of the assets based on their standard deviations and correlations. Assuming that the assets are not perfectly correlated, we can use the following formula to calculate the covariance between two assets: Cov(A,B) = σA * σB * ρAB. Using this formula and the given information, we can calculate the covariance matrix and expected returns of the assets. We can then use these values to calculate the weights of the minimum variance portfolio. The final weights of Asset A, Asset B, and Asset C are 34.7%, 42.2%, and 23.1%, respectively.
