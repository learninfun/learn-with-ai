Annuities是一種投資產品，通常用於養老儲蓄和資產保全。它是由保險公司發行的，提供給投資者一種固定的收入來源。通常，投資者可以通過定期支付一筆保費，一段時間後獲得一定額度的固定收益。

舉例來說，一個投資者可以在60歲時花10萬美元購買一份年金。根據保險公司的計算，這位投資者每年能收到6,000美元的年金，直到他 去世為止。這樣就能夠確保這位投資者在退休後每年都能得到一定額度的收入來源，並且可以在生命結束後將剩餘的資產傳給繼承人。此外，投資者在退休時也可以選擇在一段時間之內獲得更高的收益，這種投資方式被稱為可變年金。

總之，Annuities是一種可靠的資產保全和養老儲蓄方案，但需要仔細考慮個人的投資目的和風險承受能力，才能做出適當的投資決策。
