Roth IRA是美國政府資助的退休儲蓄計劃之一，它允許個人在退休時享受免稅收入。Roth IRA是一個稅後計劃，即個人投入資金時需要繳納所得稅，但在退休時可以免稅提取投資收益和本金。

例如，如果一個人在年薪為50,000美元的情況下投入了1,000美元到Roth IRA中，他/她需要支付所得稅，並且在退休時可以免稅提取此投資的收益和本金。如果在退休時這個人的賬戶增值了5,000美元，他/她可以透過提款來獲得這5,000美元的收益，而不會再繳納任何稅款。

Roth IRA的優點在於可以享受無稅收益，因此對於那些在未來預期收入仍然很高的人特別有吸引力。只有美國居民且符合某些收入限制的人才有資格開立Roth IRA賬戶。此外，Roth IRA還可以讓參與者在65歲或更早時提款而不受罰款。
