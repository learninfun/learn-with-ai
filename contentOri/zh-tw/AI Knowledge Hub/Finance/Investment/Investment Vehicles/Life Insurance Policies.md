Life insurance policies are financial contracts between an insurance company and an individual, where the insurer promises to pay a designated beneficiary a sum of money in exchange for regular premium payments. This payment is made upon the death of the insured person, or sometimes upon diagnosis of a terminal illness or critical illness.

Different types of life insurance policies may offer different coverage options, premium payment structures, and benefits. Here are some common types:

1. Term life insurance: This is a type of life insurance policy that provides coverage for a fixed period of time, such as 10, 20 or 30 years. If the insured person dies during the policy term, the beneficiary receives a lump-sum payment.

2. Whole life insurance: This is a type of life insurance policy that provides lifetime coverage, with a guaranteed death benefit and a cash value component that grows over time. Whole life insurance premiums are typically higher than term life insurance premiums.

3. Universal life insurance: This type of policy offers flexible premium payment options and adjustable death benefits, allowing the insured to increase or decrease coverage as their circumstances change. The policy also includes a cash value component that earns interest.

4. Accidental death and dismemberment insurance: This policy provides a death benefit if the insured dies from an accident, and may also provide benefits for loss of limbs or sight.

5. Final expense insurance: This policy provides coverage for the expenses associated with a person's death, such as funeral costs, casket, and burial.

For example, let's say John purchases a 20-year term life insurance policy with a death benefit of $500,000. He pays a monthly premium of $50 for the duration of the policy term. If John dies within the 20-year period, his beneficiary will receive $500,000. If John outlives the policy term, his coverage ends, and he receives no cash value or death benefit payout.
