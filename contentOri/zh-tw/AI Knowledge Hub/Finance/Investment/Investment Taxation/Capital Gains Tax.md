Capital Gains Tax是一種稅金，是對資產出售時賺取的利潤（即資本利得）所徵收的稅金。它是屬於資本利得稅（Capital Gains Tax）的範疇，其稅率通常比普通收入稅低。

例如，假設一個人以10,000美元買入某股票，並在一年後以15,000美元的價格出售，賺取了5,000美元的利潤，則根據當地的資本利得稅法，可能需要向政府繳納一定比例（例如20％）的Capital Gains Tax。

需要注意的是，如果投資者持有資產一段時間，再出售時，可能會享有更低的Capital Gains Tax稅率。这取决于持有时间的长度和国家/地区的税法规定，因此有必要仔细研究本地的税法规定并进行规划。

1. Jack bought a stock for $10,000 two years ago and sold it for $15,000. His capital gains tax rate is 20%. How much tax will he owe?

Answer: Jack's capital gain is $5,000 ($15,000 - $10,000). His capital gains tax will be 20% of this amount, which is $1,000.

2. Janice inherited a rental property from her parents. They bought the property for $100,000, and it is currently worth $200,000. If Janice decides to sell the property for $250,000, how much capital gains tax will she owe?

Answer: Janice's capital gain is $150,000 ($250,000 - $100,000). If her capital gains tax rate is 15%, she will owe $22,500 in capital gains tax.

3. Tom bought a piece of land for $50,000 five years ago. He sold it for $80,000, but he also incurred $10,000 in selling expenses. What is Tom's capital gain, and how much capital gains tax does he owe at a rate of 25%?

Answer: Tom's capital gain is $20,000 ($80,000 - $50,000 - $10,000). His capital gains tax is $5,000 (25% of $20,000).

4. Karen bought a painting for $10,000 ten years ago, and it is now worth $30,000. She donates the painting to a museum. How much capital gains tax will she owe if her tax rate is 20%?

Answer: Karen's capital gain is $20,000 ($30,000 - $10,000). However, since she donated the painting to a museum, she will not owe any capital gains tax. 

5. Robert purchased a rental property five years ago for $200,000. He sold the property for $300,000 and used the proceeds to purchase another rental property for $350,000. How much capital gains tax will he owe if his tax rate is 25%?

Answer: Robert's capital gain is $100,000 ($300,000 - $200,000). However, since he used the proceeds from the sale to purchase another rental property, he can defer paying the capital gains tax until he sells the new property. Therefore, he does not owe any capital gains tax at this time.
