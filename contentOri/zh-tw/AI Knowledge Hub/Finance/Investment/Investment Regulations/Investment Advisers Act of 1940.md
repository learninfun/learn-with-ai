Investment Advisers Act of 1940是美國國會通過的一項法案，旨在保護投資者免受不當投資顧問的損害。該法案要求所有註冊於美國的投資顧問業者在進行業務前必須註冊並遵守規定。

該法案的一些要求包括：

1. 投資顧問必須向美國證券交易委員會（SEC）註冊。

2. 投資顧問必須向客戶提供清晰的投資建議，並適當地揭示該方案的風險。

3. 投資顧問必須披露有關其業務、投資策略和業績的詳細信息。

4. 投資顧問必須向客戶披露任何可能產生衝突的利益。

5. 投資顧問必須在一定的時期內向SEC提交報告，包括客戶資產負債表、業績報告和其他相關信息。

6. 投資顧問必須遵守職業道德規範，包括禁止進行欺詐、操縱市場或購買內部消息等不當行為。

舉例來說，如果一個投資顧問公司在未經註冊的情況下向客戶提供投資建議，它可能會違反Investment Advisers Act of 1940。同樣，如果一個投資顧問向客戶隱瞞投資組合中的總體風險，以推銷風險較高的投資，也可能會違反該法案。因此，該法案旨在保護投資者免受不當投資顧問的損害，確保投資顧問公司為客戶提供清晰、透明和合法的服務。
