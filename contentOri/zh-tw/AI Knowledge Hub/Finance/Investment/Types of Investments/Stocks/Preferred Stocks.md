Preferred Stocks是一種資本工具，它結合了股票和債券的特點。這些股票通常被公司用來籌集資金，並且通常有固定的股息支付，但在償還債務時優於普通股。

Preferred Stocks通常具有以下特點：

1. 有固定股息支付，且通常高於普通股，此款股票每年有一定數額的派息金，僅次於公司還款及普通股股息

2. 如果公司被清算，持有優先股的股東優先拿到資產分配

3. 優先股持有人不擁有股東表決權，就像債券持有人一樣

以下是Preferred Stocks的一些例子：

1. Coca-Cola的Preferred Stocks

Coca-Cola公司的Preferred Stocks交易代碼為KO.PRA，每股面值為$25，於2013年發行，並以6.75%的股息率出售。這些股票在公司營運良好時，具有高收益率，優於普通股，並且在公司營運不佳時，具有保險功能。

2. Wells Fargo的Preferred Stocks

Wells Fargo公司的Preferred Stocks交易代碼為WFC-PL，每股面值為$25，於2016年發行，並以5.85%的股息率出售。這些股票在金融業波動的情況下具有穩健的表現，並且在公司營運受到不幸的事件時，有保障作用。

總之，Preferred Stocks是一種具有高回報和保障的資本工具，可以使投資者受惠於穩定的收益和業務風險。
