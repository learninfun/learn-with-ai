Growth stocks refer to companies that are expected to have a higher-than-average growth rate compared to other companies in the market. These companies typically reinvest their profits back into the company in order to expand and grow, rather than distributing dividends to shareholders.

Here are some examples of growth stocks: 

1. Amazon - as a leader in e-commerce, Amazon continues to invest heavily in expanding its product and service offerings, as well as improving its logistics and delivery infrastructure.
2. Netflix - as a pioneer in streaming video, Netflix continues to invest in creating and distributing original content, as well as expanding into new markets.
3. Tesla - as a leader in electric vehicles and renewable energy, Tesla is expected to benefit from the growing trend towards sustainable transportation.
4. PayPal - as a leading digital payment platform, PayPal is well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing shift towards e-commerce and mobile payments.

Overall, growth stocks can offer investors the potential for higher returns in the long term, but they also carry more risk than other types of stocks. It's important to conduct thorough research and analysis before investing in any company.
