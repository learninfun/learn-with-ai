Common stocks是公司股票的一種，代表著股東對公司所有權和經營權的部分擁有權。股東擁有普通股票代表對公司的部分所有權，可以參與公司的投票和分紅。

舉例來說，假設一個公司的股票分為1000萬股，其中800萬股是普通股。如果一個投資者擁有1000股，代表他對該公司的所有權比例為0.01％，並且有權利參與公司的決策和分享公司的收益。

常見的普通股包括蘋果公司(Apple Inc.)和微軟(Microsoft Corporation)等知名科技公司的股票，以及可口可樂(Coca-Cola Company)和福特(Ford Motor Company)等著名的消費品和汽車公司的股票。

1. A company's common stock currently trades at $50 per share. The company has a P/E ratio of 20 and earnings per share of $2.50. What is the company's market capitalization?

Answer: The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the stock price by the earnings per share: 50 / 2.5 = 20. Therefore, the company's market capitalization is 20 times its earnings per share: 20 x 2.5 = $50.

2. A company's common stock has a beta of 1.5 and a dividend yield of 3%. If the risk-free rate is 2.5% and the market risk premium is 8%, what is the company's expected return on equity?

Answer: The expected return on equity can be calculated using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM): expected return = risk-free rate + beta x market risk premium. Therefore, the expected return on equity is: 2.5% + 1.5 x 8% = 14.5%.

3. A company's common stock has an annual dividend of $2 per share and a current market price of $40 per share. If the dividend is expected to grow at a rate of 5% per year, what is the company's dividend yield?

Answer: The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend by the current market price: $2 / $40 = 0.05 or 5%. Since the dividend is expected to grow at a rate of 5% per year, the company's dividend yield is expected to remain at 5%.

4. A company has issued 10 million shares of common stock and has a book value per share of $30. If the company's stock is currently trading at $35 per share, what is the company's market-to-book ratio?

Answer: The market-to-book ratio is calculated by dividing the company's market price per share by its book value per share: $35 / $30 = 1.17. Therefore, the company's market-to-book ratio is 1.17.

5. A company's common stock has a price of $100 per share and an annualized dividend of $3 per share. If the company's earnings per share are $10 and the P/E ratio is 15, what is the company's dividend payout ratio?

Answer: The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the stock price by the earnings per share: 100 / 10 = 15. Therefore, the company's earnings per share are $10. The dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing the annual dividend by the earnings per share: $3 / $10 = 0.3 or 30%.
