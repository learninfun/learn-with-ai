{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



Inverse ETFs是一種交易型基金，允許投資者在市場下跌時賺錢。這些基金會使用衍生品工具，如期貨合約、選擇權等來實現其目的。當市場下跌，這些基金的價格就會上漲，因為它們的投資組合會賺錢來抵消市場的損失。反之，當市場上漲時，這些基金的價格就會下跌。

以下是例子：

1. ProShares Short S&P500 (SH) - 這是一個追踪標準普爾500指數的反向ETF，當該指數下跌時，SH的價格就會上漲。

2. ProShares Short Dow30 (DOG) - 這是一個追踪道瓊斯工業平均指數的反向ETF，當該指數下跌時，DOG的價格就會上漲。

3. Direxion Daily FTSE China Bear 3x Shares (YANG) - 這是一個追踪中國股市的反向ETF，當中國股市下跌時，YANG的價格就會上漲，並且因為它有3倍的杠桿，使得其可以獲得更高的收益。

{{< /ask_chatgpt >}}



1. Inverse ETFs are designed to move in the opposite direction of its underlying index. If the underlying index goes up by 2%, what should happen to an inverse ETF that tracks this index?

A: An inverse ETF that tracks this index should decrease by 2%.

2. A trader wants to profit from a potential decline in the energy sector. Which inverse ETF should they consider buying?

A: The ProShares UltraShort Oil & Gas ETF (DUG) is one inverse ETF that tracks the energy sector.

3. If an investor holds an inverse ETF for an extended period of time, should they expect the fund's returns to match the opposite of the index's returns?

A: Not necessarily. Inverse ETFs typically have daily leverage resets, so the returns may not be the opposite of the index's returns over a long period of time.

4. What is the difference between an inverse ETF and a regular ETF that holds short positions?

A: An inverse ETF holds a short position in its underlying index using financial derivatives like futures and swaps. A regular ETF that holds short positions actually borrows and sells shares of the stocks within the index.

5. What risks should an investor be aware of when investing in inverse ETFs?

A: Inverse ETFs are often designed to be held for only one day, and holding them over a longer period of time can cause the returns to deviate from the opposite of the index's returns. They also come with higher expense ratios than regular ETFs and are typically more volatile, so investors should be prepared for potential losses.
