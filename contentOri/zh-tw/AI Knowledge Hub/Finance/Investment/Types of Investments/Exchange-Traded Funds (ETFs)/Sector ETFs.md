Sector ETFs（行業 ETFs）是一種投資工具，它們專注於追踪某個特定的經濟部門（例如科技、能源、金融等）。

這些ETFs通常由一籃子股票組成，這些股票來自同一行業，因此可以在一個具體的經濟部門中分散投資。這種投資方式是非常有吸引力的，因為投資者可以避免風險分散不均導致的風險，並且可以獲得更高的回報。

以下是一些示例：

1.科技 ETFs：例如SPDR科技選擇指數ETF（XLK）或Invesco QQQ Trust（QQQ）

2.能源 ETFs：例如Alerian MLP ETF（AMLP）或Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF（XLE）

3.金融 ETFs：例如金融選擇指數ETF（XLF）

4.健康保健 ETFs：例如健康保健選擇指數ETF（XLV）或iShares US醫療保健ETF（IYH）

以上僅是部分Sector ETFs，投資者可以根據自己的需求選擇不同行業ETFs以達到分散投資的目的。
