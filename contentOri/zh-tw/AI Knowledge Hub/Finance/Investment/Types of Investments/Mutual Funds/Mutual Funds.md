Mutual Funds（共同基金）是一種投資工具，由多名投資者集資，由專業基金經理人管理，投資於多種不同的資產類別中，包括股票、債券、房地產和貨幣等。每個投資者擁有的份額以投資金額為基礎，依個人投資額的比例參與投資決策和收益。

舉例來說，如果一個投資者投入了10,000美元到一個股票型共同基金中，假設該基金持有蘋果、谷歌和亞馬遜等科技股票，這個投資者就持有了這個基金中1%的股份。基金經理人會負責該基金的投資組合決策，以最大化收益，最小化風險。如果這個基金投資成功，該投資者將獲得和他持有的份額相對應的收益。但如果這個基金投資失敗，該投資者也將承擔損失。

共同基金可包括不同的投資風格和資產分配，例如成長型、價值型、收益型或均衡型。此外，共同基金可以為不同的投資者提供不同的投資機會，因為它們可以涵蓋多個不同的投資領域和市場。

總之，Mutual Funds是投資多個資產類別的一種集體投資工具，讓投資者可以透過專業經理人管理和決策投資組合，獲得多元化投資和更大的收益機會。

- Mutual funds are a type of investment where a pool of money from many investors is used to buy a portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities.

- Mutual funds offer diversification, which reduces investment risk, and they can be a convenient way for individual investors to access a range of investment opportunities.

- Mutual funds charge fees, including management fees, which can impact returns. 

- Investors can buy and sell mutual fund shares at the market price, and some funds may require minimum investment amounts or have restrictions on when you can sell your shares. 

- Mutual funds are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and must disclose information about their holdings, performance, and fees to investors.

1. What is the difference between actively managed and passively managed mutual funds?

Answer: Actively managed mutual funds are managed by fund managers who actively seek out investments that will outperform the market. They charge higher fees than passively managed funds, which simply seek to replicate the performance of a market index.

2. What is meant by the term "net asset value" (NAV) in relation to mutual funds?

Answer: Net asset value is the value of all the assets held by a mutual fund minus the fund's liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding. It's the price that investors pay or receive when buying or selling shares in the mutual fund.

3. What is a load fee in mutual funds?

Answer: A load fee is a commission charged by a mutual fund company when an investor buys or sells shares in the mutual fund. These fees can be front-end, charged at the time of purchase, or back-end, charged when the investor sells shares in the fund.

4. What is the difference between a growth fund and an income fund?

Answer: A growth fund is a mutual fund that focuses on investing in stocks with the potential for high growth, while an income fund focuses on investing in stocks or bonds that generate regular income for investors.

5. What is meant by the term "asset allocation" in mutual fund investing?

Answer: Asset allocation refers to the process of dividing a portfolio among different types of investments, such as stocks, bonds, and cash, in order to achieve a balance between risk and return. It's an important part of mutual fund investing because different types of investments perform differently in different market conditions, and a well-diversified portfolio can help manage risk.
