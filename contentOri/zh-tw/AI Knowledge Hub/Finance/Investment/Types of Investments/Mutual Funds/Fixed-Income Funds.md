Fixed-income funds是一種投資基金，通常有一個特定的投資目標：將投資者的資金投入固定收益產品（例如債券），以實現穩定的投資回報。這種基金通常被視為是一種「保本」投資，因為它們提供穩定的收益，並且通常風險比較低。

這種基金有不同的風險級別，一些Fixed-Income Funds的風險較高，例如高收益債或新興市場債等。而另一些Fixed-Income Funds的風險較低，例如美國國債基金或市政債基金等。

以下是一些Fixed-Income Funds的例子：
1. iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF（TLT）- 美國政府長期債券基金，最近的10年回報平均為6.44%。
2. Fidelity Municipal Income Fund（FHIGX）-市政債基金，最近的10年回報平均為4.20%。
3. PIMCO Total Return Fund（PTTRX）-多元化的債券基金，最近的10年回報平均為5.22%。
4. Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund（VBMFX）-泛指債基金，最近的10年回報平均為4.07%。
5. iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF（LQD）- 投資評級企業債基金，最近的10年回報平均為5.98%。

這些基金為投資者提供與市場債券指數相近的回報，可在不增加風險的情況下實現持續的收益。

1. Fixed-income funds are investment vehicles that primarily invest in fixed-income securities such as bonds, treasury bills, and corporate debt instruments.

2. These funds are designed to provide regular income payments to investors through interest payments and dividend distributions.

3. Fixed-income funds are considered less risky investments as compared to equity funds as they have a lower risk of capital loss.

4. These funds are suitable for investors who are looking for a steady source of income and want to avoid the volatility associated with other investment types.

5. Fixed-income funds are managed by professional fund managers who make investment decisions based on their analysis of the creditworthiness of the issuer and the economic conditions prevailing in the market.

6. These funds also invest in government and corporate bonds with different maturities, allowing investors to tailor their investments to their individual risk tolerances and investment objectives.

7. Fixed-income funds can be purchased through mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and unit investment trusts (UITs).

8. Investors should carefully review the prospectus and other materials provided by the fund before investing to ensure the fund aligns with their investment goals and objectives.

1. What are the factors that impact the performance of a fixed-income fund?
Answer: The factors that impact the performance of a fixed-income fund include changes in interest rates, credit risk, inflation, duration risk, and liquidity risk.

2. What is the duration of a fixed-income fund, and how does it affect the fund's performance?
Answer: Duration is a measure of a fixed-income fund's sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The longer the duration, the more sensitive the fund is to interest rate changes. Higher duration funds tend to have higher yields but also carry more risk, while lower duration funds have lower yields but are less risky.

3. What is credit risk, and how does it affect the performance of a fixed-income fund?
Answer: Credit risk is the risk that a borrower will default on their debt obligations. It can impact the value of fixed-income securities held in a fund. Higher credit risk bonds tend to carry higher yields, but also carry a greater risk of default.

4. What is the difference between an active and passive fixed-income fund, and what are the advantages of each?
Answer: An active fixed-income fund is actively managed by a fund manager who selects and manages the investments. A passive fixed-income fund tracks an index and invests in the same securities as that index. The advantage of an active fund is potentially higher returns, while the advantage of a passive fund is lower expenses and a more predictable return.

5. What is the relationship between a fixed-income fund's yield and risk?
Answer: Higher yielding fixed-income funds tend to carry more risk, while lower yielding funds tend to be less risky. Yield and risk are closely related in fixed-income investing, and investors must balance their desire for higher returns with the risk of potential losses.
