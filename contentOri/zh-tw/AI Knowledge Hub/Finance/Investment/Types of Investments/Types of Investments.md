投資類型是指投資者可以選擇的不同投資方式或產品。以下是一些常見的投資類型：

1. 股票：股票是一種表示對公司所有權的證券，可以在股票市場上買賣。股票的收益率取決於公司營收和盈利，以及市場環境等因素。例： Apple Inc. (AAPL)

2. 債券：債券是一種公司或政府發行的固定收益證券，購買者可以藉此借貸給發行者並收取一定的利息。債券的回報通常較股票穩定，風險也相對較低。例：美國國債（US Treasury Bond）

3. 共同基金：共同基金是由各種不同資產組成的投資組合，由專業基金經理負責管理。共同基金的收益率取決於其所持有的資產表現，可用最小金額進行投資且風險相對較低。例： Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFINX)

4. 不動產：不動產投資包括房地產和房地產信託基金（Real Estate Investment Trusts，REITs）。房地產可以作為資產長期投資，也可產生租金和翻新價值。例： Blackstone Group Inc. (BX)

5. ETFs：ETF是代表特定市場或指數的基金，可以在股票市場上交易，通常具有與股票相似的收益和流動性。例： SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)

以上是一些常見的投資類型，每種類型都有其獨特的風險和回報特點，投資者應該根據自己的財務目標和風險承受能力來做出選擇。

1. How much return could an investor expect from a corporate bond with a rating of AA? 
Answer: The return on a corporate bond with a rating of AA can vary, but typically ranges from 3% to 5%.

2. What is the difference between a growth stock and a value stock? 
Answer: Growth stocks are companies with higher potential for growth in the future and typically have a higher price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) than the market average. Value stocks, on the other hand, are companies that are currently undervalued by the market but have solid fundamentals.

3. How is the price of a mutual fund share calculated? 
Answer: The price of a mutual fund share is calculated by dividing the total value of the fund's assets by the total number of shares outstanding.

4. What is a real estate investment trust (REIT)? 
Answer: A REIT is a type of investment that allows investors to purchase shares in a portfolio of real estate properties or mortgages. REITs are required to pay out at least 90% of their taxable income to investors in the form of dividends.

5. What is the difference between a traditional and Roth Individual Retirement Account (IRA)? 
Answer: A traditional IRA allows investors to make contributions with pre-tax dollars, which can lower their taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. A Roth IRA, on the other hand, allows investors to make contributions with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
